Periodic Solution for Neutral-Type Neural Networks in Critical Case




 
Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York A generalized neutral-type neural networks in critical case is studied. Some existence and asymptotic behavior results of periodic solution to the neutral-type neural networks in critical case are obtained by continuation theorem of coincidence degree theory and some analysis techniques. Finally, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the results in this paper.
