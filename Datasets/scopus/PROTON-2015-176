In this study, a mineral kaolinite-based proton conducting material, kaolinite-4-amidinopyridinium hydrochloride (K-4-APy-HCl), was synthesized by the intercalated compound kaolinite-4-amidinopyridine (K-4-APy) adsorbing volatilizing HCl. The thermogravimetric analysis (TG), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and IR spectrum confirmed the HCl successfully inserting into the interlayer space of kaolinite and the 4-aminopyridine being protonated. The intercalation efficiency is estimated to be ca. 85.6%. With respect to K-4-APy, the interlayer space expends by 1.53 Å. The thermal decomposition mechanism was studied by PXRD and TG techniques. The K-4-APy-HCl shows proton conductivity with σ=3.379 × 10-8 S cm-1 at 373 K and Ea=1.159 eV in the anhydrous condition, which are comparable to MOFs-based proton conducting materials.
