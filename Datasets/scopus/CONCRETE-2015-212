The large interior space requirement of public buildings leads to the development of an innovative Cable Supported Beam Structure-Concrete Slab Composite Floor System (CSBS-CSCFS). Field tests indicate that human activities can induce significant vibration of CSBS-CSCFS in some extreme cases, implying that to attenuate the dynamic response of the structure is better if the structure is expected to achieve optimum dynamic behavior. Therefore, a passive dynamic control system comprising tuned mass dampers (TMDs) is designed and installed in the structure. This paper discusses the dynamic performance of CSBS-CSCFS under human-induced loads after the installation of TMDs and the efficiency of the dynamic control system through field tests and human perception to vibration. The tests are divided into two phases, namely, free and human-induced vibration tests. Results show that the dynamic control system significantly improves the dynamic performance of the structure and human comfort. Furthermore, the efficiency of TMDs is mainly determined by the activation of TMDs, which is influenced by the coincidence of dynamic response of structure and property of dynamic control system. Generally, the human-induced vibration of CSBS-CSCFS can be well controlled by the economic and convenient methods of installing passive dynamic control devices.
