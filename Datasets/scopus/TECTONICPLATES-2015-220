New data on pre-Mesozoic intraplate magmatism in the East European Platform




 
© 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc. This study presents new data on the manifestations of pre-Mesozoic intraplate mafic magmatism beneath the Vendian–Paleozoic and Mesozoic–Cenozoic sedimentary cover of the Russian Plate. The data were obtained from interpretation of high-resolution aeromagnetic and gravity surveys performed over the past two decades. Buried volcanic structures, dike belts, trap fields, and thick mafic intrusions are described. The four phases of magmatism distinguished in this study (Riphean, Vendian, Devonian, and Late Paleozoic) are temporally correlated with the main rifting stages that took place in the East European Platform.
