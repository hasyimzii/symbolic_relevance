Proton Transverse Relaxation as a Sensitive Probe for Structure Determination in Solid Proteins




 
© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been successfully applied to elucidate the atomic-resolution structures of insoluble proteins. The major bottleneck is the difficulty to obtain valuable long-distance structural information. Here, we propose the use of distance restraints as long as 32Å, obtained from the quantification of transverse proton relaxation induced by a methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSL). Combined with dipolar proton-proton distance restraints, this method allows us to obtain protein structures with excellent precision from single spin-labeled 1 mg protein samples using fast magic angle spinning.
