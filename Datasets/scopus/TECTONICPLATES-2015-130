Morphotectonic interpretation of the Makuyuni catchment in Northern Tanzania using DEM and SAR data




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Landscapes in the East African Rift System are formed by complex effects of the active continental extension zone. These effects are caused by the Somalian micro-plate's eastward drift away from the Nubian plate, as well as by volcanic, erosional and depositional processes. Tectonic processes in this region have significantly contributed to the formation of the current drainage systems and landforms. This study focuses on the morphotectonics of the Makuyuni catchment with an analysis of topography, drainage networks, stream longitudinal profiles and lineaments. This analysis reveals a morphostructural control with an N-S trend for the uplifted Masai Block, as well as tectonic deformation in the Makuyuni catchment area (NE of Lake Manyara). Whereas basin asymmetry analysis shows basin tilting associated with active faulting and uplifting near the Essimingor volcanic cone, in this catchment the steepness and concavity indices, coupled with lineaments obtained from interpretations of Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite scenes, show an uplifting along micro-faults. Hypsometry curves reveal that subcatchments on the right side of the Makuyuni River are in a mature equilibrium phase, whereas those at the left side are in a younger stage of maturity. An investigation of base level and statistical moments of the hypsometric curves provides evidences for the spatial distribution of gully erosion phenomena. Such erosion processes are due to tectonic deformation in the northern parts of the Makuyuni catchment. These results of regional tectonic instability suggest that tectonic processes are a significant factor for the current landscape evolution in the Lake Manyara basin.
