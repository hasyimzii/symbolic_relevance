Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Some New Magnesium Formamidinates




 
Copyright Â© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. [Mg(Form)2(THF)] [Form = bis(2,6-dimethylphenyl)formamidinate (XylForm) (1), bis(2,6-diethylphenyl)formamidinate, (EtForm) (2), bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)formamidinate (DippForm) (3)] are conveniently synthesized by treating bis(2,6-dimethylphenyl)formamidine, bis(2,6-diethylphenyl)formamidine, or bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)formamidine, respectively, with half an equivalent of dibutylmagnesium in THF. Compounds 1-3 are mononuclear species in the solid state with five coordinate central metal atoms. The 1H NMR chemical shift of the formamidinate formyl proton exhibits a correlation with ligand sterics wherein increasing bulk leads to a shift to higher field.
