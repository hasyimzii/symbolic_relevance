Late Cretaceous-Paleogene transform zone between the Eurasian and North American lithospheric plates




 
Â© 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc. Within the limits of the Chukchi Sea and the Amerasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, study have been carried out to calculate D function anomalies. The result was the discovery of elongated faults that cut, according to the positions of the upper and lower extents of the disturbing masses, both the upper crust and the upper mantle. It is shown that these faults are right-lateral strike-slips continuing the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene structures of the same type in the Bering Sea. This suggests that the en echelon strike-slip system of the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Amerasian Basin is a relic of the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene transform fault zone between the Eurasian and North American lithospheric plates.
