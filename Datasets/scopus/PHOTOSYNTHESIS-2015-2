Proteomics, photosynthesis and salt resistance in crops: An integrative view




 
Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V. Salinity is a stressful condition that causes a significant decrease in crop production worldwide. Salt stress affects several photosynthetic reactions, including the modulation of several important proteins. Despite these effects, few molecular-biochemical markers have been identified and evaluated for their importance in improving plant salt resistance. Proteomics is a powerful tool that allows the analysis of multigenic events at the post-translational level that has been widely used to evaluate protein modulation changes in plants exposed to salt stress. However, these studies are frequently fragmented and the results regarding photosynthesis proteins in response to salinity are limited. These constraints could be related to the low number of important photosynthetic proteins differently modulated in response to salinity, as has been commonly revealed by conventional proteomics. In this review, we present an evaluation and perspective on the integrated application of proteomics for the identification of photosynthesis proteins to improve salt resistance. We propose the use of phospho-, thiol- and redox-proteomics, associated with the utilization of isolated chloroplasts or photosynthetic sub-organellar components. This strategy may allow the characterization of essential proteins, providing a better understanding of photosynthesis regulation. Furthermore, this may contribute to the selection of molecular markers to improve salt resistance in crops.
