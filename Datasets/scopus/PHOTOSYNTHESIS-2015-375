To investigate the growth process of Arabidopsis seedlings in response to NaHSO3 treatment and to obtain a better understanding the mechanism of NaHSO3 treatment toward Arabidopsis, microarray experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana were performed in the present study. Seedlings growth and physiological responses of Arabidopsis to NaHSO3 were investigated. The results indicated that the NaHSO3 response was related to photosynthesis pathways and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Our findings could provide valuable gene resources and theoretical information for understanding the physiological responses and dissecting the NaHSO3 response pathways in higher plants.
