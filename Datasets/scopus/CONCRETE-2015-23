The eccentric compression performance of concrete filled circular steel tubular (CFCST) columns using high-strength recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) instead of normal concrete (NC) was studied through repeat load tests on four specimens in this paper. Four specimens were divided into two groups; the first set of two specimens included a CFCST column filled with RAC and a normal CFCST column, the eccentricity was 100 mm. The second group had the same specimens and the difference was that the eccentricity was 160 mm. Load-deformation and stress-strain curves as well as the strain distribution over the cross section were obtained through the experiment. The failure characteristic, load-bearing capacity, stiffness, ductility, energy dissipation and residual deformation of the specimens were analyzed. The obtained results are compared with the ultimate strengths of CFCST columns predicted by existing design codes. The test results indicate that damage development and failure mode of CFCST columns with RAC are similar to those of normal CFCST columns. The replacement of NC with RAC has beneficial effects on the load-carrying capacity and deformation properties. The strain distribution was found to accord well with the plane section assumption. With the incensement of eccentricity, the load-carrying capacity decreased, the stiffness degradation intensified, and the deformation ability improved.
