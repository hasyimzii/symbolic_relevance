Cylindrical recycled concrete specimens with the size of ø100×200 mm after high temperature were designed to conducted conventional triaxial load test, based on which the complete stress-strain curves were acquired. The constitutive equation of recycled concrete under triaxial compression after high temperature was proposed. The results show that under uniaxial stress, the complete stress-strain curve of recycled concrete has obvious spike, and with the increase of lateral confining pressure, the curve becomes smooth and plump. The change trend of constitutive relation curve of recycled concrete under triaxial compression after high temperature is similar to the normal concrete. The fitting constitutive equation of recycled concrete under triaxial compression after high temperature agrees well with the experimental results.
