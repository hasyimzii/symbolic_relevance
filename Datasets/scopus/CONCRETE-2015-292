Evaluation of bond properties of alkali activated slag concrete




 
Blast furnace slag can be activated with mild concentration of alkalis to form a binder for concrete. This type of binder as the advantage such as a high rate of strength development without any requirement for curing. Hence it can be conveniently used for repair and rehabilitation works. However when used a repair material, one of the most important parameter that needs to be taken care of is the bond between the old concrete and the new concrete. In this paper results of three simple tests conducted to determine the bond between Portland cement based concrete (old concrete) and alkali activated slag concrete (new concrete) have been reported. The test results indicate that the bond between these two materials are sufficient for alkali activates slag concrete to be used as a repair materials.
