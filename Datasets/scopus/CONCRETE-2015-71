Study of factors influencing gussasphalt mixture performance




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Effects of mixture content, binder type, mixture gradation, modifier, and stirring time on properties of gussasphalt mixtures are investigated by fluidity, penetration, high-temperature rutting, and low-temperature bending tests. It is found that gradation and asphalt content have a strong influence and should therefore be strictly controlled during the preparation of gussasphalt mixtures. The use of a macadam coating and the addition of a modifier have strong effects on the dynamic stability of gussasphalt mixtures. The preparation technique has a strong influence on the quality of the mixture, with the optimal stirring time in the cooker being about 3 h.
