The research is questioning the advantages (inhibitory control, suppression of the interference...) and the inconvénients (verbal cognitive treatment) of bilingualism with a sample of alsatian dialectal population. It sets also the question of the reliability of diagnostic interpretations based on tests's usual standards, created for the french population, mainly monolingual and can induce false negative diagnosis of hyperactivity, Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementia... The results don't point so much to the the first question, but they do demonstrate the importance of being cautious, while interpreting the clinical results, and the necessity to conduct researches on the cognitive impact of the bilingualism with larger samples, allowing the setting of new standards for this type of population, especially in regions where bilinguals represent a majority.
