Tectonic equator and its geodynamical implications




 
Â© 2015, Science Press. All right reserved. Tectonic equator mainly represents trajectories of the motion of the lithosphere with respect to underlying mantle. It is not a common geographical equator, but is generally NWW-SEE, with a large SW-NE trending undulation from east African to the western Pacific. According to geotransects along tectonic equator, database of global plate motion and database of global active fault, we propose a tectonic equator geotransect for the first time, and try to analyze its crust structure, tectonic feature and evolution. We find that the tectonic equator is more likely crossing the Paleozoic continental crust, this may relate to their rheological properties. Along tectonic equator, the tectonic features represent extension-squeezing -extension-squeezing-extension-squeezing-extension from west to east. Tectonic equator controls development of some important plate tectonic boundaries, tectonic units, and important geomorphic units. It is an important global plate motion after the break off of Pangea, and may be affected by celestial mechanic.
