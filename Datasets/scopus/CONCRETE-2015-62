The equation for the shear capacity of UHPFRC beams with stirrups is deduced to study the shear capacity of UHPFRC beams with stirrups, based on the modified compression field theory, and considering the shear contribution of concrete in compression, shear stress transmitted across crack interface, shear carried by steel fibers and stirrups. The analysis results of nine tested UHPFRC beams in shear by the proposed equation agree well with the test values, and the variation coefficient is small. It is suitable for shear analysis and design for UHPFRC beams with stirrups.
