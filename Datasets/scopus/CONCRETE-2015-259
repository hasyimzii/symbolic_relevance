Increasing durability of lightweight concrete through FRP wrap

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) wraps on reducing chloride ingress and increasing the durability of lightweight concrete. Several prior studies have dealt with FRP application on normal weight concrete. However, the literature on externally bonded FRP application on lightweight concrete is sparse. This study involved an accelerated testing to determine concrete degradation and decrease in chloride ingress and associated increased durability that FRP wrapping can provide to lightweight concrete. Forty two cylinders were subjected to electricity induced accelerated testing in a saline solution for 50 days. Samples were removed from the immersion tank after specific failures and analyzed for chloride content and failure modes. Both lightweight and normal weight concrete greatly benefited from FRP wrapping in terms of increased time to failure and reduced concrete chloride. Lightweight concrete generally performed better with Carbon FRP (CFRP), and normal weight concrete with Glass FRP (GFRP). CFRP wraps produced the best overall protection. Multiple wraps were more effective at reducing chloride ingress than single wraps. Lightweight concrete had greater chloride permeability reductions, whereas normal weight concrete benefited more from FRP confinement effects. The majority of sample failures were caused by cracking in the concrete substrate.
