Analysis of Guinean new mining fiscal regime: Considerations for improvement




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. From 1990s the mining regulatory and legal framework that supported great harmonization and stability in Africa mining sector has not fully contributed in creating more opportunities of foreign investments. In line with this aforementioned Guinea adopted a new mining code in September 2011 which replaced the mining code of 1995. This study sheds light on some of the central issues in the continuing process of mining legislation revision, the short term optimization of mining taxes and incentives attractiveness so as to illustrate their effects on both government revenues and returns on investment. Through a quantitative comparison of the tax rates in the context of developed and developing resources-rich countries, it can be concluded that the past regulatory frameworks are uncompetitive in terms of foreign investments' attraction. The new regulation code itself has some negative impacts on the previous investments, as well as bringing down living standards in areas of critical importance for socio-economic development.
