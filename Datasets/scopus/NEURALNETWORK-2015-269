Statistical testing of segment homogeneity in classification of piecewise-regular objects




 
Â© 2015 Andrey V. Savchenko et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2015. The paper is focused on the problem of multi-class classification of composite (piecewise-regular) objects (e.g., speech signals, complex images, etc.). We propose a mathematical model of composite object representation as a sequence of independent segments. Each segment is represented as a random sample of independent identically distributed feature vectors. Based on this model and a statistical approach, we reduce the task to a problem of composite hypothesis testing of segment homogeneity. Several nearest-neighbor criteria are implemented, and for some of them the well-known special cases (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler minimum information discrimination principle, the probabilistic neural network) are highlighted. It is experimentally shown that the proposed approach improves the accuracy when compared with contemporary classifiers.
