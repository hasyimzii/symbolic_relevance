Synthesis of substituted 2-vinylfurans




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. K2CO3 (3a)-mediated (3+2) cycloisomerization of β-ketosulfones 1 with 1,4-dichloro-2-butyne (2) in acetone afforded substituted 2-vinylfurans 4 at 56 °C for 8 h in good yields. The one-pot tandem route provides mild, facile and efficient reaction conditions. A plausible mechanism has been discussed and proposed.
