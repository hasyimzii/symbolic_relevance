Railways and the local economy Evidence from Qingzang railway




 
This article exploits a natural experiment created by a newly constructed railway in Qingzang province of China to investigate the effect of railway infrastructure on the local economy. The findings of this study are relevant to transportation investment in developing economies, as the railway is located in two of the least developed provinces, such as Qinghai and Tibet. The study applies the difference-in-difference (DD) method to estimate the railway effect on the local economy. It specifically distinguishes railway counties from off-railway counties and compare the economic development of these two groups before and after the arrival of the railway.
