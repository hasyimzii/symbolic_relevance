Flow mechanism of concrete based on dispersion model




 
Â© 2015, Tongji University. All right reserved. Concrete can be divided into two components: mortar and coarse aggregate. The influence of both rheology and amount of mortar on concrete flowability was studied. The results show that the lubrication among coarse aggregate is determined by the rheology of mortar, and spatial separation of coarse aggregate is determined by the amount of mortar. Both factors decrease the stability of concrete system, and thus promote to flow. The factors are influenced each other, that is to say, when one factor exceeds a critical value, the effect of the other will be weakened. The dispersion model can fully explain the correlation of composition, structure and performance. The change of concrete proportions can transform into change of the two factors, that is a new way to predict and control the concrete performance.
