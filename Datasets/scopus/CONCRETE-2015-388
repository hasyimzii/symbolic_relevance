An experimental investigation on flexural behaviour of fibre-reinforced pond ash-modified concrete




 
© 2015 Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University. The flexural behaviour of plain and fibre-reinforced pond ash concrete (FRC) beams under monotonic loading condition was analysed. Sixteen beams reinforced with top and bottom longitudinal deformed steel bars and transverse steel stirrups were tested. The beams were cast using three different percentages of pond ash, namely, 10%, 20% and 30% by weight of cement. Grooved type steel fibres were incorporated at different percentages of 0.5%, 1% and 2% by volume of concrete. Beams of cross section 150 mm × 150 mm and length 700 mm were tested in flexure under three-point bending system (one loading point plus two simple supports). Addition of fibres increased the failure load of the beams and ensured ductile behaviour. Ductility index and flexural rigidity of the beams were also studied. The predicted crack width (ACI 224 R-01) was compared with the measured crack width, and a good correlation was obtained.
