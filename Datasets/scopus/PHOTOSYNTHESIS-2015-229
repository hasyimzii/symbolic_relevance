Photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence responses of Populus sibirica to water deficit in a desertification area in Mongolia




 
Â© 2015 The Institute of Experimental Botany In the present study, photosynthetic traits and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of Populus sibirica grown under different irrigation regimes were investigated to estimate seedling growth and vitality for reforestation in a desertification area. According to our results, photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence were significantly affected by water deficit only under severe drought conditions.
