The Tiansheng Port special ship channel bridge of the Hutong Changjiang River Bridge is a flexible arch bridge with three-span continuous rigid girder with span arrangement (140+336+140) m. The foundation for the main pier No. 3 of the bridge has 36 nos. of φ2.5 m bored piles and deeply embedded rectangular pile cap that is in dimensions of 55 m×25 m×6.5 m. The pile cap was constructed by the double-wall steel cofferdam (58.1 m×28.1 m and 20.6 m high) that was simultaneously used as the water-retaining structure and the formwork for concrete casting of the pile cap in the construction. The software ANSYS was used to set up the finite element model for the cofferdam structure and through calculation of the stress of the base sealing concrete and the bonding forces between the concrete and steel casings in the cofferdam, it was determined that the C25 concrete of 3.4 m depth should be used for the base sealing concrete. When the cofferdam was dredged and sunk down to the cofferdam top elevation +5.2 m, the base sealing concrete of the cofferdam was cast from the upstream to the downstream sides of the cofferdam, using the central concrete hopper, dumping of the concrete from agitators and a number of tremie ducts. After the construction of the base sealing concrete was completed, the problem of the water leakage was not found and the construction was completely successful. In the light of the construction conditions in the field, the optimization proposals on the schemes of the concrete quality and tremeie duct arrangement were made as well.
