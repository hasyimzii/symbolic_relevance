New meta-depsidones and diphenyl ethers from the lichen Parmotrema tsavoense (Krog & Swinscow) Krog & Swinscow, Parmeliaceae




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Chemical investigation of the ethyl acetate extract of lichen Parmotrema tsavoense (Krog & Swinscow) Krog & Swinscow, Parmeliaceae, collected in Vietnam, afforded 7 new secondary metabolites, including 5 new meta-depsidones (1-5), 2 new diphenyl ethers (6, 7), together with 10 known compounds. Their chemical structures were elucidated by analysis of 1D and 2D NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopic data, as well as by comparison with those reported in the literature. We also proposed a possible biosynthetic route for the formation of new compounds of P. tsavoense from the readily accessible precursors atranorin and methyl β-orsellinate. The cytotoxic activities of five new compounds against liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human lung cancer (NCI-H460) and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines were evaluated.
