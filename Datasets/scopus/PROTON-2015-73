Visible-Light-Mediated Oxidative Decarboxylative Coupling of Cinnamic Acid Derivatives with Tetrahydrofuran




 
Â©2015 Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart New York Synlett. A visible-light-mediated protocol for direct oxidative decarboxylative coupling of various cinnamic acid derivatives with tetrahydrofuran was developed, leading to simple preparations of a range of vinyltetrahydrofurans under operationally mild and convenient conditions.
