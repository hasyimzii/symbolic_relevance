Impact of epicrystallization modifying on characteristics of cement rock and concrete




 
© Research India Publications. There has been established the set of processes running upon epicrystallization modification of the cement matrix and stages of formation of composites structure by use of artificial aggregate based on granulated reactive silica powders have been considered. Use thereof allows improving the cement matrix structure by means of defect minimization and formation of the closed cell system. Analysis of porosity of separate segments of fine-aggregate concrete on the basis of artificial aggregate based on granulated reactive silica powders allowed ranking them by degree of reduction of nanoporosity. Using the X-ray phase analysis and infrared spectroscopy methods the active chemical and structure-forming effect of the reagent material artificial aggregate based on granulated reactive silica powders on the surface of mineral formations of cement rock have been proved. The described processes determine the fact that upon increase in the total composite porosity as the results of introduction of artificial aggregates based on granulated reactive silica powders to 55–60% reduction of the composite thermal conductivity by 9–12 times, that of water saturation – by 4 times, increase in concrete strength characteristics by 2 times is observed. The voids being formed instead of artificial aggregate based on granulated reactive silica powders have tightened walls and prevent water migration, thereby increasing the concrete water-proofing and water-resistance of a construction product in general, at that 95% macro-pores of the produced composite are closed.
