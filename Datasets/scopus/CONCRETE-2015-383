Assessing condition assesment of concrete pier after three decades of exposure to sea water | [Ocjena stanja betonskog obalnog zida izloženog djelovanju morske vode VIše od 30 godina]




 
This paper presents the effects of long-term exposure of concrete structures to marine environment using as an example concrete blocks of a pier exposed to seawater for more than three decades. The blocks were tested to determine their mechanical characteristics (compressive strength), durability (gas permeability and capillary absorption), homogeneity (sclerometer rebound and ultrasound passage velocity) and chemical properties (quantity of chloride and sulphate ions). In addition, concrete behaviour in sea water was modelled using software packages Stadium and Conclife.
