The aim of this work was to evaluate pot size and glyphosate rate interaction on the growth, physiology and control of Brachiaria decumbens weed. It was sowed in 2, 5, 10 and 20 L-pots, which were kept in greenhouse. Plant growth was assessed from 41 to 63 days after plant emergence (DAE). Glyphosate was applied to all pot sizes at 0.0, 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 kg ha-1, at 64 DAE. Leaf gas exchange was assessed along with chlorophyll fluorescence at two days after application (DAA); weed control level at 7, 14, 21 and 28 DAA; weed dry matter at 28 DAA; and weed sprouting dry matter at 28 days after weed cutting. B. decumbens growth increased linearly with increased pot size. Both weed gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were affected by glyphosate rates, but not by pot size. No significant interaction between glyphosate doses and pot size on weed control levels was found, but it increased strongly with increasing herbicide rates and only slightly with pot size, particularly up to 14 DAA. Weed dry matter at 28 DAA and plant regrowth differed according to pot size and glyphosate dose interaction. It was concluded that pot size should be precisely chosen to test systemic herbicide efficacy on the control of B. decumbens.
