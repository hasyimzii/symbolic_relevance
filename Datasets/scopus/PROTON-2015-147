Synthesis and in vitro cytotoxicity of novel C-12 substituted-14-deoxy-andrographolide derivatives as potent anti-cancer agents




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Andrographolide, the major labdane diterpenoid from Andrographis paniculata has been reported to be cytotoxic against various cancer cells in vitro. Our research efforts led to the discovery of novel 12-phenyl thio and 12-aryl amino-14-deoxy-andrographolide derivatives (III q and III r) with potent cytotoxic activity, 12-benzyl amino-14-deoxy-andrographolide analogues showing broad range of cytotoxic activity against most of the cell lines and 12-alkyl amino-14-deoxy-andrographolide derivatives being selective to few cell lines (PC-3 and HOP-92), when the selected analogues were evaluated against 60 human cancer cell line panel at National Cancer Institute (N.C.I.), USA. The SAR (structure activity relationship) studies demonstrated potent activity for the compounds containing the following functionalities at C-12: substituted aryl amino/phenyl thio > benzylamine > alkyl amine. The significant cytotoxic activity observed for compounds III q and III r suggest that these could serve as templates for further optimization.
