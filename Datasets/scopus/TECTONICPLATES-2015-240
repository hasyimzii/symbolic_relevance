Ambient noise surface wave tomography of the Makran subduction zone, south-east Iran: Implications for crustal and uppermost mantle structures




 
© 2015, The Author(s). Seismic ambient noise of surface wave tomography was applied to estimate Rayleigh wave empirical Green’s functions (EGFs) and then to study crust and uppermost mantle structure beneath the Makran region in south-east Iran. 12 months of continuous data from January 2009 through January 2010, recorded at broadband seismic stations, were analyzed. Group velocities of the fundamental mode Rayleigh wave dispersion curves were obtained from the empirical Green’s functions. Multiple-filter analysis was used to plot group velocity variations at periods from 10 to 50 s. Using group velocity dispersion curves, 1-D vS velocity models were calculated between several station pairs. The final results demonstrate significant agreement to known geological and tectonic features. Our tomography maps display low-velocity anomaly with SW-NE trend, comparable with volcanic arc settings of the Makran region which may be attributable to the geometry of Arabian Plate subducting beneath the overriding the Lut block. The northward subducting Arabian Plate is determined by high-velocity anomaly along the Straits of Hormuz. At short periods (<20 s), there is a sharp transition boundary between low- and high-velocity transition zone with the NW trending at the western edge of Makran which is attributable to the Minab fault system.
