Transcriptome Profile in Response to Frost Tolerance in Eucalyptus globulus




 
Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. The genetic improvement of trees for freezing tolerance is one of the most important goals to extend the plantations to colder areas. RNA-Seq technology has become a key tool in transcriptome studies. It can quantify overall expression levels for each gene simultaneously with high efficiency and speed through in silico gene expression, where differentially expressed genes can be identified by measuring the reads mapped for each transcript. In this study, the results of ESTs libraries from two Eucalyptus globulus genotypes showing contrasting differences in frost tolerance after cold acclimation using mRNA-Seq and in silico gene expression are discussed. A total of 14,265 non-redundant transcripts were predicted, where 163 corresponded to upregulated and 537 to downregulated genes. Pathway analyses of upregulated transcripts indicated that differences in frost tolerance might be regulated by the tree response to chemical and osmotic stimulus and organic substances, principally by overexpressing proteins that respond to hormone stress. These results suggest that genes coding for dehydrins, outer envelope, and voltage-dependent anion channel proteins are likely to participate in the regulation of the cold acclimation process and may have an important role in frost tolerance. The transcription factor analysis allowed identifying that those most differentially expressed in a resistant genotype were participating in the regulation of transcription, hormone regulation, photosynthesis, and response to stress. Additionally, the screening of polymorphic EST-SSR in silico and the validation of these markers in a reference population lead to identify a polymorphic EST-SSR with potential use for plant breeding and genotype discrimination.
