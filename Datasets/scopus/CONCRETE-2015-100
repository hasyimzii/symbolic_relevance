Shaking table test and numerical analysis of a high-rise building with steel reinforce concrete column and reinforce concrete core tube




 
Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Summary This paper assesses the seismic performance of a high-rise building with steel reinforce concrete column and reinforce concrete core tube in Shanghai, China. This building has 54 floors above the ground and 4 basements, and it has two strengthened layers, which are composed of outrigger truss and belt truss. In order to validate the reliability and the safety of this structure, besides the conventional analysis, shaking table test of scale model was conducted. In the test, the maximum responses of acceleration and deformation were measured and evaluated, as well as the dynamic characteristics, crack pattern, and failure mechanism of the building. Meanwhile, elastic-plastic time-history analysis for prototype structure was carried out by the finite element analysis program, and the experimental data were compared with the analytical results to gain a better understanding of the seismic performance of the building. The conclusions are summarized below: Shaking table test of scale model is an effective method to understand the failure mechanisms and seismic performance of high-rise building with steel reinforce concrete (SRC) column and reinforce concrete core tube. To high-rise building, a whipping effect is remarkable. The stiffness and ductility of the stories closed to the roof should be paid more attention. In the strengthened layers, the outrigger truss and the belt truss are the main structures to resist a large part of seismic action. The stiffness of the stories between the strengthened layers is mutated, and the focus phenomenon of shear force on these stories is obviously serious. The lateral stiffness ratio of core tube to SRC columns should not be large. Well controlling of the size of these lateral resistance members can make them to give fully play to seismic capacity.
