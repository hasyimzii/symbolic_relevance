Reactive oxygen species: Reactions and detection from photosynthetic tissues




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have long been recognized as compounds with dual roles. They cause cellular damage by reacting with biomolecules but they also function as agents of cellular signaling. Several different oxygen-containing compounds are classified as ROS because they react, at least with certain partners, more rapidly than ground-state molecular oxygen or because they are known to have biological effects. The present review describes the typical reactions of the most important ROS. The reactions are the basis for both the detection methods and for prediction of reactions between ROS and biomolecules. Chemical and physical methods used for detection, visualization and quantification of ROS from plants, algae and cyanobacteria will be reviewed. The main focus will be on photosynthetic tissues, and limitations of the methods will be discussed.
