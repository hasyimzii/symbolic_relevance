Formation of radial symmetric needle-like rosette leaves in Arabidopsis




 
Â© 2015 Institute of Botany, Slovak Academy of Sciences. In the bodies of seed plants, lateral organs of the shoot, for example cotyledons, leaves, and floral organs, are determinate and exhibit localized planer growth resulting in breaking of radial symmetry and asymmetric development. Localized planer growth in the leaf generates the leaf blade, the principle site of photosynthesis in most plants. Development of flat and expanded lamina is an important physiological process. In these processes, a few kind of meristems cooperate with regulating leaf development. In this work, with transfer sense ASL11, sense ASL38 and antisense ASL15 under 35S promoter to to Arabidopsis (Col-0), we found a series of radial symmetric needle-like rosette leaves. By analyzing the anatomical and the epidermal cell features, our data suggests that in these malformed leaf blades, a few meristem tissues all can be suppressed or accelerated, and normal leaf blade morphology disappears. Pro ASL11:GUS expression further suggests that this process may be triggered by misexpression of a few transcription factors (Tfs).
