In order to explore the influence of anti-freezing agent on bubble stability performance of concrete air-entraining agent, the cement slurry bubble test was carried out considering sensitivity factors which was four kinds of anti-freezing agents and different dosages, and analyzed its effects on foaming ability, stabilizing foam ability and mechanism. The results revealed that bubble volume attenuation index model of shake bubble test was set up, which parameters characterized the foaming ability and stabilizing foam ability of different air-entraining agents. Calcium nitrate had a positive effect on stabilizing foam ability of the saponins air-entraining agent, and anti-freezing agents had a negative effect on it. Ethylene glycol had a positive effect on foaming ability of the benzene sulfonate air-entraining agent, the significance of improving the stabilizing foam ability was calcium nitrite>calcium nitrate>ethylene glycol. Four kinds of anti-freezing agents all had a negative impact on the air content of fresh concrete mixed with the saponins air-entraining agent, the most significant of it was ethylene glycol, and the least significant was calcium nitrite. Calcium salts anti-freezing agents had a negative impact on the air content of fresh concrete mixed with Benzene sulfonate air-entraining agent, ethylene glycol had a positive effect on it.
