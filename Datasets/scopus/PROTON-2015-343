One-Pot Synthesis of Novel Highly Functionalized Furan-Based Polyphenolics




 
© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart · New York. Novel, highly functionalized furan-based polyphenolics were prepared. The employed methodology involves a one-pot 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) catalyzed 1,4-conjugate addition of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds on 3-bromochromones, furan heterocyclization, and chromanone ring opening.
