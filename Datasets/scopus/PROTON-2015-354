Microbial Transformation of 14-Anhydrodigoxigenin by Alternaria alternata




 
© 2015 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zürich. The microbial transformation of 14-anhydrodigoxigenin (1) by Alternaria alternata CGMCC 3.577 led to the production of seven new metabolites, 2-8. Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic (CD, IR, 1D- and 2D-NMR, and HR-ESI-MS) data analyses. The reactions in the bioprocess exhibited diversity, including specific oxidation, hydroxylation, reduction, epoxidation, and dehydration. In addition, a hypothetical biocatalytic pathway is proposed.
