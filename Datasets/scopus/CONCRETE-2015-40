Recent developments in the design of advanced composite materials for construction have led researchers to create novel high-performance structural elements that combine fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) shapes with traditional materials. The current study analyzes the experimental structural response of eight hybrid beams made of pultruded glass FRP (GFRP) profiles mechanically connected to reinforced concrete (RC) slabs, suitable for building floors as well as footbridge and marine pier superstructures. The influence of partial interaction is studied by considering a low degree of shear connection and an analytical assessment of the whole response is carried out using previous formulations, highlighting a good accuracy. The behavior of the hybrid beams is further evaluated against that of equivalent reinforced concrete beams and single GFRP profiles, thus proving the feasibility of the solution.
