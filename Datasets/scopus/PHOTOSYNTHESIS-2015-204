The Photosystem II D1-K238E mutation enhances electrical current production using cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes in a bio-photoelectrochemical cell




 
Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. The conversion of solar energy (SEC) to storable chemical energy by photosynthesis has been performed by photosynthetic organisms, including oxygenic cyanobacteria for over 3 billion years. We have previously shown that crude thylakoid membranes from the cyanobacterium Synechocytis sp. PCC 6803 can reduce the electron transfer (ET) protein cytochrome c even in the presence of the PSII inhibitor DCMU. Mutation of lysine 238 of the Photosystem II D1 protein to glutamic acid increased the cytochrome reduction rates, indicating the possible position of this unknown ET pathway. In this contribution, we show that D1-K238E is rather unique, as other mutations to K238, or to other residues in the same vicinity, are not as successful in cytochrome c reduction. This observation indicates the sensitivity of ET reactions to minor changes. As the next step in obtaining useful SEC from biological material, we describe the use of crude Synechocystis membranes in a bio-photovoltaic cell containing an N-acetyl cysteine-modified gold electrode. We show the production of significant current for prolonged time durations, in the presence of DCMU. Surprisingly, the presence of cytochrome c was not found to be necessary for ET to the bio-voltaic cell.
