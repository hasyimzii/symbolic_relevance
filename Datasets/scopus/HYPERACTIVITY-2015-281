Introduction: There is an increasing awareness of the strong associations between obesity and adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with high rates of ADHD (26-61%) in patients seeking weight loss. Aims: To determine the frequency of ADHD in a bariatric surgery (BS) sample and investigate whether there were any differences among clinical, analytical and psychological parameters in individuals with criteria for ADHD. Methods: Sixty patients (78.3% female, age 46.3±9.8, months since BS 46.28±18.1) who underwent BS, with a minimum follow-up of 18 months, were evaluated cross-sectionally. Initial and current BMI, eating patterns, comorbidity, socio-demographic and biochemical parameters were recorded. For the screening of ADHD, ADHD self rating scale-v1.1 was administered. Results: Nineteen individuals (31.6%) had a positive screening for ADHD. This group had higher levels of HDL-cholesterol (62.8±17.3mg/dl vs 53.5±9.9mg/dl; p=0.011) and Apo-A (177.7±28.4mg/dl vs 154.9±34.7mg/ dl; p=0.015), and an increased consumption of lipids (42.2±7.1% vs 36.7±8.3%; p=0.019). Subjects with ADHD symptoms had more difficulties in following visits after BS (52.6% vs 24.3%; p= 0.011).We could not find any differences in achieved BMI, depressive symptoms or quality of life. Conclusions: Patients who met criteria for ADHD face significant difficulties with compliance in follow-up, but we could not find differences in major clinical outcomes. Surprisingly, these patients could have a protective lipid profile.
