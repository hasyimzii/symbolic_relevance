The closure buckle steels was applied to improve the traditional steel grouted connecting precast wall to improve the mechanical properties of the steel grouted connecting precast wall. By the low cyclic loading experimental test of the improved steel grouted precast wall connector, that the closure buckle steels can efficiently improve the mechanical properties of the steel grouted connecting precast wall, was proved. After that, in order to determine the capacity calculation method for the improved steel grouted precast wall connector, this paper analyzed the typical shear failure mechanism of steel grouted connecting precast wall, especially the interface failure, and proposed the simplified capacity calculation model for the improved steel grouted precast wall connector. Afterward, by combining with the capacity calculation formulas of the cast-in-place shear wall provided by the current design code, the capacity calculation method for the improved steel grouted precast wall connector was determined. Finally, the joint capacity of the connector was calculated using the proposed calculation formulas and the section integral method. By comparing the calculated capacity using the method proposed above to the section stress integral calculation results and the experimental test results; it can be illustrated that the proposed simplified capacity calculation model and the calculation method for the improved steel grouted precast wall connector can be reasonable.
