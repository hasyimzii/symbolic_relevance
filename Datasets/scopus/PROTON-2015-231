Terpenoids from Euphorbia pekinensis




 
© 2015 Taylor & Francis. Euphorpekone A (1) and euphorpekone B (2), two new diterpenoids, 3β-hydroxy-25-methyloxylanosta-8,23-diene, a new triterpenoid (3), together with a known triterpenoid, 3β,25-dihydroxylanosta-8,23-diene (4), were isolated from Euphorbia pekinensis Rupr. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of UV, IR, 1D (1H, 13C, NOE) and 2D (1H-1H COSY, HSQC, HMBC) NMR, HR-ESI-MS, X-ray diffraction analysis, and CD method.
