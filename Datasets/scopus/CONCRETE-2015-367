Experimental research on concrete filled steel tubular frame structure designed on hybrid yield mechanism




 
Â© 2015, Engineering Mechanics Press. All right reserved. Seismic safety of concrete filled steel tubular frame structure designed based on hybrid yield mechanism was investigated experimentally, and the impact of local buckling and welding on structural performance was studied. The parameters included the width to thickness ratio of yield column and strength ratio of column to beam. Two hybrid yield mechanism frame structures were designed. Horizontal low cyclic loading test of the frame structures were conducted with column under certain axial force. The relationship between story shear force and story drift angle of the structures was obtained, the deformation and damage of yield column were analyzed, and the feasibility and seismic safety of the structure designed based on hybrid yield mechanism were verified.
