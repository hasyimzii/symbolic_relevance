Research on performance of aramid fibre composite




 
Â© 2015 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. Aramid Fiber Reinforced Polyme is a kind of complex material with light weight. It is convenient for construction with great strength and efficiency. It is used to improve the bearing capacity in the strengthening and restoration of the structure. In this paper, based on the test of beam, the author considers load effect ratio and the structure under different load combinations by JC method and then researches the changes of reliable degree. Through the calculation of reliability of beam before and after reinforcement of reinforced concrete beam analysis, the author finds aramid fibre can contribute to the degree of reliability of bending reinforce beam. Research shows that the bending capacity of reinforced concrete beam can improve the role of aramid fibre significantly, as well as strengthen the reliability index with the regular decreases with the increase of load effect in different load combinations. The author hopes this research can provide a reference for the reliability analysis of the future research of aramid fibre reinforced concrete member.
