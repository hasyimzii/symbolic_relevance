Highly enantioselective tandem double Michael reactions catalyzed by Ni(acac)2/(+)-MINBOL complex




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. An in situ prepared complex of chiral ligand (+)-MINBOL 1 and Ni(acac)2 (12.5 mol % and 0.5 mol % respectively) can efficiently catalyze enantioselective tandem double Michael reactions. In this reaction, aryl or alkyl nitroalkenes were employed as electrophiles. The corresponding tandem adducts were obtained in good yields and with high enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee).
