Temperature profile extraction using artificial neural network in BOTDA sensor system




 
Â© 2015 IEEE. We propose and demonstrate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based temperature profile extraction from local Brillouin gain spectrum in BOTDA fiber sensor system. Results show that ANN can adopt large frequency scanning step and hence reduce BOTDA measurement time significantly.
