Stereochemical assignment of α-santonin using residual dipolar coupling | [Atribuição da estereoquímica da α-santonina através das medidas do acoplamento dipolar residual]




 
The measurement of nuclear magnetic resonance parameters in an anisotropic media, such as residual dipolar coupling (RDC), has proven to be an excellent methodology for the refinement of chemical structures, being used as a complementary tool in the determination of the relative configuration, conformation, and constitution of organic compounds. In this study, we applied this methodology to determine the relative configuration of α-santonin, a natural product with four stereocenters, while assigning its prochiral methylene protons using only the RDCs obtained in a polyacrylonitrile polymer gel swollen in DMSO-d6.
