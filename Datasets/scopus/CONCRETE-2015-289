Correlation between mortar and concrete behavior using rheological analysis




 
Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Rheological behavior of concrete is closely related to the rheology of its mortar. This paper aims to study the relation between the rheological parameters of mortars and its corresponding concretes. The correlation between the compressive strength of mortars and the corresponding concretes is also considered. Workability of mortars and concretes, prepared with different amounts of metakaolin and diatomite, were controlled either with water or a water reducing admixture. A direct relationship was observed between the rheological parameters of mortars and its corresponding concretes. Formulations with metakaolin show a linear correlation between the mortars and the corresponding concretes compressive strength. Values of the mortars's compressive strength was 84% of the ones of corresponding concretes. Although without a linear correlation, in compositions with diatomite where the workability adjustment was done with a water reducing agent, the values of mortars's compressive strength were also 85% of the values of corresponding concretes.
