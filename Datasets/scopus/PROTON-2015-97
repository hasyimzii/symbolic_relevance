Formation of new C-O and C-N bonds via base promoted Csp2-Csp3 bond cleavage of α-nitro ketone




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. A catalyst free protocol has been developed for nucleophilic C sp2 -Csp3 bond cleavage of α-nitroketone in the presence of potassium carbonate to create new C-O and C-N bonds. A series of different substituted α-nitroketones could be selectively cleaved and converted into corresponding esters and tosylamides in the presence of alcohols and bromamine-T, respectively.
