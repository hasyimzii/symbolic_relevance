Improved syntheses of β-octabromo-meso-triarylcorrole derivatives




 
© 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. In spite of significant applications as starting materials for a variety of metallocorrole derivatives, free-base β-octabromo-meso-triarylcorroles continue to be viewed as inaccessible. The reasons range from the need for tedious column-chromatographic purification to limitations of the reductive demetallation protocol for selected systems. Here we report that column chromatography may be entirely avoided for a number of β-octabromo-meso-tris(p-X-phenyl)corrole derivatives, where X = CF3, NO2, F, H, CH3, and OCH3; instead, analytically pure products may be obtained by recrystallization from chloroform/methanol. In addition, we have presented an optimized synthesis of the heretofore inaccessible, sterically hindered ligand β-octabromo-meso-tris(2,6-dichlorophenyl)corrole, H3[Br8TDCPC], via reductive demetallation of the corresponding Mn(III) complex. With our earlier report of β-octabromo-meso-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole, H3[Br8TPFPC], a comprehensive set of optimized synthetic protocols are thus in place for a good number of β-octabromo-meso-triarylcorrole ligands. Furthermore, we have illustrated the use of these ligands by synthesizing the iron complexes Fe[Br8TDCPC]Cl and Fe[Br8TDCPC](py)2, of which the latter lent itself to single-crystal X-ray structure determination.
