Freezing the Butterfly Motion of Carbamazepine Derivatives




 
© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart New York Synthesis 2015. Atropisomeric properties were found in carbamazepine derivatives. The atropisomers of N-acyl and N-thiocarbamoyl derivatives of carbamazepine were isolated, with high stereochemical stability. It has been elucidated that the rotation about the N-C1′ axis around the outer amide N-(C=O) does not coordinate with the rotation of the butterfly-like motion.
