The piers No. 9~22 of the simply-supported steel truss girder bridge of the Hutong Changjiang River Bridge are located in the hydraulic reclamation area in the Henggang Islet shallow water. The foundations for the piers are the φ2.2 m bored piles that are 108~118 m long and the pile caps thereof are the rectangular shapes that are in dimensions of 38.2 m×26.8 m×5 m for the piers No. 9 and No. 22 and 38.2 m×21.1 m×5 m for the piers No. 10~21. To select the reasonable construction scheme for the pile cap foundation pits, two schemes of the steel sheet pile cofferdam (Scheme 1) and the light well-point dewatering (Scheme 2) were proposed and through comparison of the economy, safety, construction efficiency and construction equipment, the Scheme 2 was chosen. In the Scheme 2, the light well-point pipes were laid out in rings all round and the pipes were laid on the two terraces in a pit and in the upper, middle and lower rings. The excavation slope of the pit was 1:0.75 and each one row of the water cut-off pipes was respectively laid out on the inner sides nearby the upstream and downstream surrounding dykes. From the calculation of the water yield in the pit, it was known that the theoretic needed well-point pipes in the scheme were 379 and actually 450 pipes were laid. In the construction, the techniques of the terrace dewatering, step-by-step excavation and side slope protection of timely jetting the concrete were applied. Presently, the construction of the pile cap foundation pit excavation in the area has been completed and in the foundation pits, there is no problem of the water leakage and the construction effect is sound.
