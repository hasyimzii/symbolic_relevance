Newton meets Van Leeuwenhoek: Identifying international investors' common currency preferences




 
Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc. Using a novel security-by-security dataset, this paper distinguishes investor preferences for euro-denominated debt securities from investor preferences for debt securities issued by euro area residents. We estimate a gravity model and show that investors have a preference for securities in their home country and countries close to their home country. Furthermore, investors have a strong preference for holding debt securities denominated in euros. Whether a security is issued by a euro area resident or a non-euro area resident is of secondary importance. These results are important for the literature on international investment positions for identifying investors' currency preferences.
