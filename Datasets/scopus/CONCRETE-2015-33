Assessing the effects of recycled asphalt pavement materials on the performance of roller compacted concrete

In some countries of the world, for economic and environmental reasons, recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) materials comes from old bituminous road pavements are increasingly investigated. In Algeria particularly, a huge quantity of this type of waste is produced every year but rarely quantified and rarely reused. This paper evaluate the effects of various RAP sizes as substitute of coarse and fine natural aggregate (NA) on the mechanical properties and durability of roller compacted concrete (RCC). The RAP and NA materials are characterized and compared. The mechanical properties and durability of RCC with RAP materials are analyzed and compared to the RCC with 100% of NA. The experimental results showed that it is possible to manufacture RCC with a maximum of 50% of RAP materials. In addition to that, it may be more environmentally efficient to valorise this type of waste in concrete, because this helps to remove in general some parts of wastes and protects the environment.
