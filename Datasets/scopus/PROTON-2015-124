A new proton transfer complex of [6,6′-dmbipy.H]2[PtCl6] (1) was prepared from the reaction of H2PtCl6.6H2O with 6,6′-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine (6,6′-dmbipy) in CH3CN at room temperature. The cyclometalated complex of mer-[Pt(6,6′-dmbipy-κ2N,C)Cl3(DMF-κO)] (2) was prepared from the recrystallization of complex 1, in a mixture of DMF/DMSO/H2O (6:2:1) at 60 °C, in which the first C-H bond activation in a bipyridine ring with Pt(IV) ion was observed. In vitro cytotoxicity against four cultures: NIH-3T3, Caco-2, HT-29 and T47D were studied using MTT assays. Interestingly, compound 2 is more potent in killing a colon cancer cell line than cisplatin, since it exhibits extensively less toxicity on normal cells. Both complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV-Vis spectra and X-ray crystallography.
