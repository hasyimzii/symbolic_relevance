Synthesis of cynaropicrin-d4




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Cynaropicrin is a guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone, which has potent in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against Trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan parasite that causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT; sleeping sickness). Herein, we describe the synthesis of cynaropicrin's deuterated derivative, cynaropicrin-d4, by the replacement of the side chain of natural cynaropicrin. The synthesized cynaropicrin-d4 could be employed as an internal standard for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, in the pharmacokinetic study of cynaropicrin. This could potentially advance the study of this therapeutic lead.
