Tectonic evolution and high-pressure rock exhumation in the Qiangtang terrane, central Tibet




 
© Author(s) 2015. Conflicting interpretations of the > 500 km long, east - west-trending Qiangtang metamorphic belt have led to very different and contradicting models for the Permo - Triassic tectonic evolution of central Tibet. We define two metamorphic events, one that only affected pre-Ordovician basement rocks and one subduction-related Triassic high-pressure metamorphism event. Detailed mapping and structural analysis allowed us to define three main units that were juxtaposed due to collision of the north and south Qiangtang terranes after closure of the Ordovician - Triassic ocean that separated them. The base is formed by the Precambrian - Carboniferous basement, followed by non-metamorphic ophiolitic mélange containing mafic rocks that range in age from the Ordovician to Middle Triassic. The top of the sequence is formed by strongly deformed sedimentary mélange that contains up to > 10 km size rafts of both unmetamorphosed Permian sediments and high-pressure blueschists. We propose that the high-pressure rocks were exhumed from underneath the south Qiangtang terrane in an extensional setting caused by the pull of the northward subducting slab of the Shuanghu - Tethys. High-pressure rocks, sedimentary mélange and margin sediments were thrust on top of the ophiolitic mélange that was scraped off the subducting plate. Both units were subsequently thrust on top of the south Qiantang terrane continental basement. Onset of Late Triassic sedimentation marked the end of the amalgamation of both Qiangtang terranes and the beginning of spreading between Qiantang and north Lhasa to the south, leading to the deposition of thick flysch deposits in the Jurassic.
