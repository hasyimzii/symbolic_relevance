Ore-forming porphyries and barren granitoids from porphyry Cu deposits differ in many ways, particularly with respect to their adakitic affinity and calc-alkaline characteristics. In this study, zircon U-Pb and molybdenite Re-Os dating, whole rock geochemistry, whole rock Sr-Nd-Pb and zircon O-Hf isotopic analyses were carried out on the ore-forming granitoids from the Kounrad, Borly and Sayak deposits, and also on pre-ore and post-ore granitoids in adjacent regions of Central Kazakhstan. Geochronology results indicate that pre-ore magmatism occurred in the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous (361.3-339.4Ma), followed by large scale Cu mineralization (325.0-327.3Ma at Kounrad, 311.4-315.2Ma at Borly and 309.5-311.4Ma at Sayak), and finally, emplacement of the Late Carboniferous post-ore barren granitoids (305.0Ma). The geochemistry of these rocks is consistent with calc-alkaline arc magmatism characterized by strong depletions in Nb, Ta and Ti and enrichments in light rare earth elements and large ion lithophile elements, suggesting a supra-subduction zone setting. However, the ore-forming rocks at Kounrad and Sayak show adakitic characteristics with high Sr (517.5-785.3ppm), Sr/Y (50.60-79.26), (La/Yb)N (9.37-19.62) but low Y (6.94-11.54ppm) and Yb (0.57-1.07ppm), whereas ore-forming rocks at Borly and barren rocks from northwest of Borly and Sayak have normal arc magma geochemical features. The Sr-Nd-Hf-O isotopic compositions show three different signatures: (1) Sayak granitoids have very young juvenile lower crust-derived compositions ((87Sr/86Sr)i =0.70384 to 0.70451, e(open)Nd (t)=+4.9 to +6.0; TDM2 (Nd)=580 to 670Ma, e(open)Hf (t)=+11.3 to +15.5; TDM C (Hf)=330 to 600Ma, δ18O=6.0 to 8.1‰), and were probably generated from depleted mantle-derived magma with 5-15% sediment melt addition in the magma source; (2) the Kt-1 granite from northwest of Sayak shows extremely enriched Sr-Nd isotopic compositions ((87Sr/86Sr)i =0.71050, e(open)Nd (t)=-7.8, TDM2 (Nd)=1700Ma), likely derived from partial melting of ancient continental crust; (3) other granitoids have transitional Sr-Nd compositions between the Sayak and Kt-1 samples, indicating a juvenile lower crust source with the addition of 10-30% of ancient crustal material. The pre-ore magmatism was probably related to partial melting of juvenile lower crust due to northward subduction of the Junggar-Balkhash Ocean, whereas the ore-forming adakitic rocks at Aktogai, Kounrad and Sayak formed by partial melting of thickened lower crust which subsequently delaminated. The ore-forming rocks at Borly, and the later post-ore barren granites, formed by partial melting of juvenile lower crust with normal thickness. This tectonic setting supports the existence of an Andean-type magmatic arc in the Devonian to the Late Carboniferous, resulting from the subduction of the Junggar-Balkhash oceanic plate. The link between whole rock geochemistry and scale of mineralization suggests a higher metallogenic potential for adakitic rocks than for normal arc magmatism.
