Changes of transcriptome and proteome are associated with the enhanced post-anthesis high temperature tolerance induced by pre-anthesis heat priming in wheat




 
Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht This study was to explore the mechanism of the enhanced tolerance to post-anthesis high temperature stress induced by pre-anthesis heat priming in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Genome-wide gene expression profiles by Affymetrix Wheat Genome Chip and proteome analysis by 2D electrophoresis and MALDI TOF/TOF were performed in the leaf after pre-anthesis heat priming and post-anthesis high temperature stress. Physiological analyses indicated that primed plants showed higher rates of photosynthesis, activities of antioxidant enzymes and lower cell membrane oxidative damage, suggesting a less high temperature damage in the primed plants. 88 gene probes and 8 protein spots were regulated after both pre-anthesis heat priming and post-anthesis high temperature stress, and the probes and proteins were expressed differently in primed plants from those in non-primed plants. Transcriptome and proteome analyses revealed up-regulation of the genes that encoded sensing and signaling, heat shock proteins, redox homeostasis, and down-regulation of the genes that encoded metabolism. The up-regulation and down-regulation might play protective roles in coping with the post-anthesis high temperature stress in the pre-anthesis heat primed plants compared with non-primed plants. It is concluded that pre-anthesis heat priming could initiate the acclimation responses at both transcriptome and proteome levels for enhancing heat tolerance at later stages in wheat plants. These results are of primary importance for understanding the effects of multi-heat stress on production of wheat crops in future climate change scenarios.
