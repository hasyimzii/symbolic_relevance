The autogenous shrinkage of concrete can be improved obviously in the internl curing of concrete, and improve the strength of concrete. effect of super-absorbent polymer (SAP) on mortar workability and autogenous shrinkage and strength of concrete were studied. Results indicate that through SAP to introduce 15 kg conservation of water into per cubic metre of mortar or concrete as a reference, the different ratio of SAP and water was mixed into mortar, tested the fluidity of mortar, the best proportion of m(SAP):m(water)=1:25 was determined, and this amount is added into mortar and concrete. the effect of stirring time on mortar fluidity of adding SAP was analysised, provided some suggestions for the practical application of SAP in the mortar. Pre-saturated SAP added into mortar and concrete can obviously improve the strength and autogenous shrinkage, and the internal curing effect of SAP is more significant with the water cement ratio.
