Neural dysfunction in ADHD with Reading Disability during a word rhyming Continuous Performance Task




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc. Background: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous, neurodevelopmental disorder which co-occurs often with Reading Disability (RD). ADHD with and without RD consistently have higher inattentive ratings compared with typically developing controls, with co-occurring ADHD and RD also demonstrating impaired phonological processing. Accordingly, inattention has been associated with greater phonological impairment, though the neural correlates of the association are poorly understood from a functional neuroimaging perspective. It was postulated that only the co-occurring subgroup would demonstrate hypoactivation of posterior, left hemispheric, reading-related areas and, to a lesser extent, alterations in right hemispheric, attention areas compared with controls. Methods: A novel word rhyming Continuous Performance Task assesses functional activation differences in phonology- and attention-related areas between three groups: ten boys with ADHD and RD, fourteen boys with ADHD without RD, and fourteen typically developing controls. Subjects respond to words that rhyme with a target word as mono- and disyllabic, English words are visually presented over 90. s blocks. Results: Behavioral performance was not different between groups. Some hypoactivation of left hemispheric, reading-related areas was apparent in ADHD and RD, but not ADHD without RD, compared with controls. Right hemispheric, attention areas showed alterations in both ADHD subgroups relative to controls; however, the differences for each subgroup were dissimilar. Conclusions: The dorsal decoding subnetwork may not be grossly compromised in ADHD with Reading Disability. The role of cognitive impairments, including the level of inattention, on phonology requires clarification from a neuroimaging perspective.
