Cathodic protection characteristics and maintenance of concrete structures which received salt damage deterioration




 
Â© 2015 The Society of Materials Science, Japan. The occurrence of deterioration in concrete structures due to salt damages is increasing rapidly, making its maintenance problematic. Although cross-sectional repair and surface coating methods are implemented as counteractive repair measures of deteriorated structures, there is still the problem of re-deterioration. Conversely, while cathodic protection has been undertaken as a repair measure, it was not popular because it was a newly introducedtechnology at that time. However, since many of the actual structures in which cathodic protection was applied have sustained a high anticorrosion effect even after more than 20 years, its application in recent years is increasing. In this study, we investigate the interpretation and maintenance method of the different characteristics of cathodic protection from the environment on the basis of the exposure test data and the actual structure data.
