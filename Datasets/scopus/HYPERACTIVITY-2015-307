Evidence-based treatment of ADHD in integrated primary care




 
Â© 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. Many primary care patients and their families unnecessarily endure Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms in addition to frequent comorbid conditions; yet they often lack information regarding the diagnosis and treatment options for ADHD. Primary care is the most common setting for patients to seek treatment for ADHD, although many patients will not follow through with external referrals to specialty behavioral health care. FDA-approved medications and psychosocial treatments for ADHD have proven to be effective in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The coordination and combination of these treatment modalities in integrated primary care can better address a patient's needs (especially in regard to associated symptoms of ADHD across the lifespan and frequent comorbidities). There is a need for a comprehensive assessment, a coordinated treatment plan, and the continued monitoring of ADHD symptoms over time; and an integrated care model of treatment can effectively provide this level of care.
