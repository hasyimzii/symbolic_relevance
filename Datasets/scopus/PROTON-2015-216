Simulation of orientated catalyst layer in PEMFC using a microstructure lattice model




 
Â© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica. The orientated cathode in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell was simulated and compared with a random cathode using a microstructure lattice model. The differences between catalyst utilization and electrode performance were studied. Transport and electrochemical reactions in the model catalyst layer were calculated. The orientated cathode performed better than the traditional random cathode and was explained by variations of the oxygen levels, the over potential and the reaction rate across the catalyst layer with cell current density. Additionally, we examined the electrode performance at different thicknesses. Unlike the traditional random cathode, a thinner orientated cathode performed better.
