Amination of Arylboronic Compounds via the Copper-Catalyzed Addition of Arylboronic Esters to Azodicarboxylates




 
Â© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart . New York. Arylboronic esters add to di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate under mild reaction conditions (at room temperature) to afford aryl-substituted hydrazine derivatives in good yields. The reaction tolerates a wide variety of functional groups.
