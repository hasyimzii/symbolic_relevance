© 2015, Copyright © The Institute of Behavioral Finance. In this study, the relationship between three institutional investors' trading behaviors and Taiwan stock index futures returns is investigated. Empirical results show that foreign institutional investors (FINI) in the futures market are negative feedback traders while the investment trusts are positive feedback traders. Both trading behaviors follow the returns of index futures. Moreover, the net trading volume of FINI has a significantly positive effect on Taiwan stock index futures returns. In addition, the impact of Taiwan stock index returns for the open interest has a persistent effect. Finally, it was found that extreme net open interest of dealers predicts Taiwan stock index futures.
