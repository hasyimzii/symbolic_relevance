International Variations in the Benefits of Feasible Diversification Strategies




 
Â© 2015 World Scientific Publishing Co. We examine the international variations in portfolio diversification benefits from an angle of global wealth management. We directly model the impact of widely observed phenomenon, home bias and no short-sales, on international investments with the aim to establish feasible diversification strategies and to identify which countries and/or regions are target markets for wealth management. Our results indicate that investors in less developed countries, particularly in East Asia and South Asia, reap greater benefits from international diversification than investors in the rest of the world. These benefits are particularly noticeable in volatility reduction. Our results reveal important insights for global wealth management.
