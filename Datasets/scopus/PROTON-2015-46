Catalytic Electrophilic C-H Silylation of Pyridines Enabled by Temporary Dearomatization




 
A C-H silylation of pyridines that seemingly proceeds through electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) is reported. Reactions of 2- and 3-substituted pyridines with hydrosilanes in the presence of a catalyst that splits the Si-H bond into a hydride and a silicon electrophile yield the corresponding 5-silylated pyridines. This formal silylation of an aromatic C-H bond is the result of a three-step sequence, consisting of a pyridine hydrosilylation, a dehydrogenative C-H silylation of the intermediate enamine, and a 1,4-dihydropyridine retro-hydrosilylation. The key intermediates were detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy and prepared through the individual steps. This complex interplay of electrophilic silylation, hydride transfer, and proton abstraction is promoted by a single catalyst.
