The antioxidant activity of 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives and some sulfured analogs




 
Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. In this work, the relationship between the structure and the radical scavenging activity of seven hydroxycoumarins and their sulfured analogs was investigated for the first time by density functional theory calculation in the gas phase, benzene, and water. Our investigation includes hydrogen atom transfer, single-electron transfer-proton transfer, and sequential proton loss electron transfer mechanisms. The results revealed that the bond dissociation enthalpy values of sulfured coumarins were lower than those of hydroxylated analogs. The obtained results were in a good agreement with the experimental results. The hydrogen atom transfer mechanism is dominant in both benzene and vacuum. The sequential proton loss electron transfer mechanism represents the most thermodynamically preferred reaction pathway in water. However, single-electron transfer-proton transfer mechanism is not the most preferred one in all media. Finally, this work contributes to the understanding of the pharmacological activity of the compounds studied.
