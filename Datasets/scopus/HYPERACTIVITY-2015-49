Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate: A Treatment Option for Children and Adolescents with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Germany and Across Europe | [Lisdexamfetamindimesilat: Eine Behandlungsoption für Kinder und Jugendliche mit Aufmerksamkeitsdefizit-/Hyperaktivitätsstörung in Deutschland und Europa]




 
© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder - which may persist into adolescence and adulthood. Psychostimulants and atomoxetine (ATX) are frequently prescribed to treat ADHD in Germany. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is the most recently approved ADHD medication in Germany and other European countries. Data used to support the European registration of LDX is summarised from three phase-3/3b studies in children and adolescents with ADHD. Short-term efficacy (study SPD489-325), maintenance of efficacy (study SPD489-326) and efficacy in patients who had previously responded inadequately to methylphenidate (MPH) treatment (study SPD489-317) were demonstrated. The safety and tolerability profile of LDX in all three European studies was shown to be in line with that of other psychostimulants used to treat patients with ADHD.
