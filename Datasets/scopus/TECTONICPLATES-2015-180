An introduction to the national energy program - Gas hydrate exploration in Taiwan




 
Â© 2015 IEEE. The heavy rainfall accompanying typhoons and summer torrential rains washes organic sediment from the high mountains into the deep sea southwest of Taiwan. The waters depth is over 1000 m just 30 km off the coast. Moreover, Taiwan locates on the collision zone of Eurasian Plate and Philippine Sea Plate. Thick layers of organic sediment, along with activities of tectonic plate movement provides a perfect ground for the formation of gas hydrate. In 2003, Central Geological Survey (CGS), Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan started the preliminary survey for gas hydrate in the southwest waters of Taiwan. The primary acoustic signature for the existence of gas hydrate, Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR), was found in many regions of the waters. To further confirm and find out the details of the distribution and the deposits, CGS initiated a four-year survey project from 2004 to 2007, and followed by another phase from 2008 to 2011. More than twenty professors formed several teams to take care of issues ranging from BSR seismic survey, deep sea ecology monitoring, in-house gas hydrate formation simulation, gas hydrate triggered geo-hazard assessment. Starting from 2012, Gas Hydrate Project was officially transferred to Taiwan National Energy Program - Phase II as one the themes for finding clean energy for the next generation. This paper briefs on the efforts Taiwan has put on gas hydrate survey in the past decade, the current status, and the future plan. Some of the survey results will also be summarized.
