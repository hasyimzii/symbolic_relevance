Ferric Perchlorate Promoted Reaction of [60]Fullerene with N-Sulfonyl Aldimines: Synthesis and Functionalization of Fulleroxazolidines




 
Â© 2015 American Chemical Society. The rare fulleroxazolidines 2 were successfully synthesized by the facile ferric perchlorate promoted reaction of [60]fullerene with various N-sulfonyl aldimines 1. Further functionalization of fulleroxazolidines by arenes in the presence of boron trifluoride afforded 1,4-bisarylation products 4. A possible reaction mechanism for the formation of the fulleroxazolidines is proposed.
