Structure design of shaped charge for requirements of concrete crater diameter

By using theories of shaped jet formation and crater diameter growth during jet penetrating concrete, we revealed the thresholds of the velocity and diameter of jet head, and therefore obtained the related structure parameters of top liner, so that shaped charge structure was developed. We built a ∅60 mm copper liner and a ∅142 mm Ti-alloy liner which followed the rules of 0.6 cal and 0.7 cal in-crater diameter. respectively. X-ray experiment and penetration test results showed that the parameters of jet head were consistent with the results of theoretical analysis. The in-crater diameter of ∅60 mm shaped charge reached 36 mm, and the ∅142 mm one reached 100 mm. They both met the design requirements.
