Does the Chinese Diaspora Speed Up Growth in Host Countries?




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. We compiled a new, enhanced data set on the population share of overseas Chinese covering 147 countries over the period 1970-2010. Linking the migration and economic growth literature, this article attempts to estimate the impact of the Chinese diaspora on economic growth in host countries. Regression results from both, "Barro-type" and dynamic panel data models suggest that a country's initial relative endowment with overseas Chinese is positively related to subsequent growth. Results are robust to a number of sensitivity tests. The effect is transmitted via increased trade openness, enhanced investment, and general TFP effects.
