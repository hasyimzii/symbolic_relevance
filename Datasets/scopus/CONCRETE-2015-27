Post-build concrete wing wall reinforce frame corner column seismic performance experimental




 
Â© 2015, Editorial Board of Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology. All right reserved. 6 specimens of post-build concrete wing wall located two neighboring faces of corner columns were designed and conducted to study the seismic performance of the post-build concrete wing wall reinforce frame corner column. Three test axial compression ratio including 0.31, 0.36, 0.40 was designated for exiting frame corner columns. HRB400 was used as longitudinal steel bar. The ratio of longitudinal reinforcement was 1.23%, 1.05%, 0.82% and stirrup with HPB300 ratio 0.6%. The results of six specimens under cyclic reversing load show that damage degree of the parallel wing wall away from the corner column was significant, while the corner column and the perpendicular wing wall were damaged lighter. Existing column could resist vertical loads and horizontal seismic actions. The wing walls could bear horizontal seismic action and as an effective dissipation energy component.
