Selective analysis of sulfur-containing species in a heavy crude oil by deuterium labeling reactions and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry

A heavy crude oil has been treated with deuterated alkylating reagents (CD3I and C2D5I) and directly analyzed without any prior fractionation and chromatographic separation by high-field Orbitrap Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (FTMS) and Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) using electrospray ionization (ESI). The reaction of a polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles (PASHs) dibenzothiophene (DBT), in the presence of silver tetrafluoroborate (AgBF4) with ethyl iodide (C2H5I) in anhydrous dichloroethane (DCE) was optimized as a sample reaction to study heavy crude oil mixtures, and the reaction yield was monitored and determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR). The obtained conditions were then applied to a mixture of standard aromatic CH-, N-, O- and S-containing compounds and then a heavy crude oil, and only sulfur-containing compounds were selectively alkylated. The deuterium labeled alkylating reagents, iodomethane-d3 (CD3I) and iodoethane-d5 (C2D5I), were employed to the alkylation of heavy crude oil to selectively differentiate the tagged sulfur species from the original crude oil.
