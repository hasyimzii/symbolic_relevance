Modulating the Stability of 2-Pyridinyl Thermolabile Hydroxyl Protecting Groups via the "chemical Switch" Approach




 
© 2015 American Chemical Society. A novel and effective method is presented for modulating the stability of 2-Pyridinyl Thermolabile Protecting Groups (2-Py TPGs) in the "chemical switch" approach. The main advantage of the discussed approach is the possibility of changing the nucleophilic character of pyridine nitrogen using different switchable factors, which results in an increase or decrease in the thermal deprotection rate. One of the factors is transformation of a nitro into an amine group via reduction with a low-valent titanium in mild conditions. The usefulness of our approach is corroborated using 3′-O-acetyl nucleosides as model compounds. Their stability in various solvents and temperatures before and after reduction is also examined. Pyridine N-oxide and pH are other factors responsible for the nucleophilicity and stability of 2-Pyridinyl Thermolabile Protecting Groups in thermal deprotection. Protonation of 4-amino 2-Pyridinyl Thermolabile Protecting Groups is demonstrated by 1H - 15N HMBC and HSQC NMR analysis.
