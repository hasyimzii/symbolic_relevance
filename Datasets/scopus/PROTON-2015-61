Preparation of 111In on CS-30 cyclotron




 
© 2015, Science Press. All right reserved. 111In was prepared on the CS-30 cyclotron in Sichuan University via nuclear reaction NatCd(p,xn) 111In with natural cadmium target by electro-deposition method. The procedures of dissolution and radiochemical separation of the irradiated cadmium target were investigated. The results indicate that the 111In of 25-28 MBq/(μA·h) can be obtained using the proton of 26 MeV bombarded on the natural cadmium target, with radiochemical separation of Cu2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and In by adopted CL-P204 resin. The radionuclide purity of 111In produced by natural Cd is more than 99%. The total chemical impurity of Cu2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+ is less than 8.0 mg/L.
