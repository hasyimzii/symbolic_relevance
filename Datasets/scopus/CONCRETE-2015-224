Static and dynamic analyses of abutment stability and dam cracking of a roller-compacted concrete high-arch dam




 
Â© 2015, Academia Sinica. All right reserved. The seismic response of high-arch dam in meizoseismal area is of great importance. Analysis of static stability and ultimate seismic resistance is one of the crucial issues to ensure the reservoir safety during earthquakes. By using the verified parameters after the Wenchuan Earthquake and considering the influence of strength reduction, the static and dynamic analysis for Shapai roller-compacted concrete arch dam are performed based on physical model tests and numerical calculation. Through the 3D static geomechanical model destruction test by comprehensive method, the stability of arch dam abutment under the normal load is studied. The comprehensive stability safety coefficient is determined as 3.76, and the areas destroyed seriously are suggested to be reinforced. Based on this, the 3D dynamic finite element analysis is conducted based on the method of superposition response spectrum. The calculated stresses are used to analyze the dynamic response of Shapai arch dam after reinforcement, based on the Drucker-Prager criterion and Mohr-Coulomb criterion. The fracture situation of dam and ultimate seismic resistance are discussed. The calculation results show that the seismic resistance of Shapai arch dam is good, only the instability of shallow surface will occur under the condition of earthquake in ten thousand years. The results also show that the abutment stability and reinforcement effect of Shapai arch dam is favorable. Thus Shapai arch dam performed very well with regard to overall stability and seismic resistance in "5.12" Wenchuan Earthquake. The comprehensive researches and these engineering treatment measures can provide valuable reference for other similar projects in meizoseismal area.
