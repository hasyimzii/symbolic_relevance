Terminalia arjuna bark extract alleviates nickel toxicity by suppressing its uptake and modulating antioxidative defence in rice seedlings




 
© 2015 Springer-Verlag Wien Terminalia arjuna (Ta) bark contains various natural antioxidants and has been used to protect animal cells against oxidative stress. In the present study, we have examined alleviating effects of Ta bark aqueous extract against Ni toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.). When rice seedlings were raised for 8 days in hydroponics in Yoshida nutrient medium containing 200 μM NiSO4, a decline in height, reduced biomass, increased Ni uptake, loss of root plasma membrane integrity, increase in the level of O2˙−, H2O2 and ˙OH, increased lipid peroxidation, decline in photosynthetic pigments, increase in the level of antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase and alterations in their isoenzyme profile patterns were observed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed damage to chloroplasts marked by disorganised enlarged starch granules and disrupted thylakoids under Ni toxicity. Exogenously adding Ta bark extract (3.2 mg ml−1) to the growth medium considerably alleviated Ni toxicity in the seedlings by reducing Ni uptake, suppressing generation of reactive oxygen species, reducing lipid peroxidation, restoring level of photosynthesis pigments and ultrastructure of chloroplasts, and restoring levels of antioxidative enzymes. Results suggest that Ta bark extract considerably alleviates Ni toxicity in rice seedlings by preventing Ni uptake and reducing oxidative stress in the seedlings.
