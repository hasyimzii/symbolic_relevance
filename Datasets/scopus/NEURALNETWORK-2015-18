Sea clutter constituent synthesis approach based on a new decomposition model




 
Â© 2015, Zhang et al. In this paper, a sea clutter decomposition model is newlxy proposed. The decomposition structure is organized according to a comparison study between measured sea clutter and Lorenz chaotic signals. Based on the decomposition model, a sea clutter constituent synthesis approach is developed to reconstruct sea clutter series with neural networks. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach.
