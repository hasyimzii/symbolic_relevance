Almost Automorphic Solutions of Impulsive Cellular Neural Networks with Piecewise Constant Argument




 
Â© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York. In this paper we discuss the existence and uniqueness of almost automorphic solutions of an impulsive model of neural network with piecewise constant argument. These kind of solutions are more general than periodic and almost periodic solutions. The results are established by using fixed point theorem. We give several sufficient conditions for the exponential and global attractivity of the solution. At the end an example with numerical simulation is given to illustrate our analytical findings.
