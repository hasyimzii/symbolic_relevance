Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. [(tert-Butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]methanethiol [HSCH2OSiMe2Bu-t] is a nucleophilic reagent for introduction of a protected bivalent sulfur; this reagent is complementary to the electrophilic reagent p-MeC6H4SO2SCH2OSiMe2Bu-t. The thiol is prepared by the action of HSLi on tert-butyl(chloromethoxy)dimethylsilane [ClCH2OSiMe2Bu-t] and it reacts with alkyl bromides to give protected thiols.
