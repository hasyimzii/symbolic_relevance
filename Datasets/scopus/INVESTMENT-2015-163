From Transition to Opportunity: Security, Institutional Strengthening and Economic Development. Southeastern Europe Revisited




 
© 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York. This paper aims to analyze the economic dimension of security in Southeastern Europe. Practical development in the region will lead to the request of collective integration of the remaining states in the Euro-Atlantic structures. Financial security, the new “buzz words” in political and foreign policy affairs will assure development, prosperity, and growth. Fiscal security cannot be assured or guaranteed unless there is a clear projection of an ambitious plan for a total growth and development in all fields of a structured community or country. This paper proposes the creation of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) program through the creation of the Interoperable European Development Network (IEDN). The IEDN will be “a road map” for renewed development in Southeastern Europe, and the FDI will be its tool for reconstruction of the region. It is expected that its application will effectively and in practice, tackle the existing fiscal crisis in the region.
