A novel in situ synthesized magnetite containing acrylonitrile and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate grafted poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposite membranes for pervaporation separation of acetone/water mixtures




 
© 2015 Elsevier B.V. In this study separation of acetone/water mixtures was investigated by pervaporation (PV) technique using poly(vinyl alcohol)-g-acrylonitrile/2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-Fe3O4 (PVA-g-AN/HEMA-Fe3O4) nanocomposite membranes. AN and HEMA was grafted onto PVA by irradiating with UV light. The graft copolymer was characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), carbon-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Magnetite nanoparticles were in situ synthesized in copolymer membrane and the membrane was characterized by using FTIR, DSC, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and contact angle measurements. Membrane performance was examined by changing the feed composition (0-100wt.%) and operating temperature (30-50°C). The highest separation factor of 120 was obtained with 80wt.% acetone concentration in the feed.
