On stability criteria for neural networks with time-varying delay using Wirtinger-based multiple integral inequality




 
Â© 2015 The Franklin Institute. All rights reserved. This paper investigates the problem of delay-dependent stability analysis of neural networks with time-varying delay. Based on Wirtinger-based integral inequality which suggests very closed lower bound of Jensen's inequality, a new Wirtinger-based multiple integral inequality is presented and it is applied to time-varying delayed neural networks by using reciprocally convex combination approach of high order cases. Three numerical examples are given to describe the less conservatism of the proposed methods.
