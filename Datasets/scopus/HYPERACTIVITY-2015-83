Promoting psychosocial adaptation of youths in residential care through animal-assisted psychotherapy




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. The goal of this study was to examine the influence of animal-assisted psychotherapy (AAP) on the psychosocial adaptation of a group of adolescents in residential care who had suffered traumatic childhood experiences and who presented with mental health problems. This study recruited 63 youths (mean age = 15.27, SD= 1.63) who were divided into two groups: a treatment group of 39 youths (19 female and 20 male; mean age = 15.03, SD= 0.51) and a control group of 24 (five female and 19 male; mean age = 15.67, SD= 1.63). The youths who underwent the AAP program had higher school adjustment in comparison to their peers who did not receive treatment. Their hyperactive behavior decreased, and they showed better social skills, more leadership, and fewer attention problems. They also showed a more positive attitude toward their teachers in comparison to controls. No differences were observed in other variables associated with clinical symptoms or personal adjustment. These results suggest that AAP can be effective with teenagers who have suffered childhood traumas and who present with problems of psychosocial adaptation.
