Fire protection thickness of concrete-filled fire-resistant steel tubular columns




 
Â© 2015, Zhejiang University. All right reserved. Fire protection thickness of CFT of FR steel was analyzed under certain fire resistances To obtain fireproof performance of concrete-filled steel tube(CFT) of fire-resistant(FR) steel in the fire. Fireproof retardant coating, cement mortar were used as fire protection for CFT of FR steel with circular cross section. And autoclaved aerated concrete slabs, cement mortar were used as fire protection for CFT of FR steel with square cross section. The temperature field of CFT was obtained by ANSYS under different concrete strengths, steel ratios, load eccentricity ratios, sizes, fire resistances, slenderness ratios, steel strengths. The fire protection thickness were solved with numerical technique. The simplified calculation formulas for predicting the thickness were deduced, which was found to be in good agreement with numerical results. The calculation formula can be referenced for the fire protection design of practical engineering. Parametric analyses show that fire protection thickness of CFT of fire-resistant steel decrease significantly compared with CFT of ordinary steel. Therefore, the building space is saved.
