Anthracene adamantylbisurea receptors: Switching of anion binding by photocyclization




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Anion binding of adamantane bisurea receptors 1-4 bearing anthracene chromophores was investigated in DMSO solution by UV-vis and fluorescence titrations. All derivatives form stable complexes with F- (K1:2≈105-106 M-2), AcO- (K1:1≈103 M-1), and H2PO4 - (K1:1≈103-104 M-1, K1:2≈105-106 M-2). Photochemical reactivity of 1-4 in the [4π+4π] photocyclizations was also investigated. Anthracene 1 is photochemically stable, 3 and 4 undergo reaction giving mixture of products, but 2 reacts selectively yielding only cyclic product 5. Product 5 was isolated and characterized by X-ray analysis. Cyclic receptor 5 also binds anions but forms complexes with different stability constants than its opened analogue 2. Anthracene 2 forms more stable complex with H2PO4 -, whereas cyclic receptor 5 forms the most stable complex with AcO- (K1:1 >106 M-1).
