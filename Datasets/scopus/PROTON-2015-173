Interaction of Azobenzene and Benzalaniline with Strong Amido Bases




 
Â© 2015 American Chemical Society. The interaction of azobenzene with lithium dicyclohexylamide (Cy2NLi) in THF or Et2O afforded the ion-radical salt of azobenzene (1) structurally characterized for the first time and dicyclohexylaminyl radical, which begins a novel chain of transformations leading eventually to the imino-enamido lithium complex (3). Benzalaniline, being a relative of azobenzene, reacted with Cy2NLi without electron transfer by a proton-abstraction mechanism to form the dilithium salt of N1,N2,1,2-tetraphenylethene-1,2-diamine quantitatively.
