The microwave-assisted ortho-alkylation of azine N-oxides with N-tosylhydrazones catalyzed by copper(i) iodide




 
Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016. A copper catalyzed regioselective cross-coupling of N-tosylhydrazones with azine N-oxides to yield ortho-alkylated products in moderate to good yields is reported. The reaction is facilitated by microwave, takes place without any ligand, and uses inexpensive copper(i) iodide as the catalyst.
