Cationic nanogels as Trojan carriers for disruption of endosomes




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. The comparison study of interaction of linear poly(2-dimethyl amino)ethyl methacrylate and its cationic nanogels of various cross-linking with both DNA and sodium poly(styrene sulfonate) has been performed. Although all amino groups of the nanogels proved to be susceptible for protonation, their accessibility for ion pairing with the polyanions was controlled and impaired with the cross-linking. The investigation of nanogels complexes with cells in culture that was accomplished by using of calcein pH-sensitive probe revealed a successive increase in the cytoplasmic fluorescence upon the growth in the cross-linking due to calceine leakage from acidic compartments to cytosol. This regularity implies that amino groups which are buried presumably inside the nanogel are protected against the ion-pairing with polyanions of plasma membrane and hence are able to manifest buffer properties while captured into acidic endosomes, i.e. possess lyso/endosomolytic capacity. These findings suggest that network architecture makes an important contribution to proton sponge properties of weak polycations.
