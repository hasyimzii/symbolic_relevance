The main ship channel bridge of the Hutong Changjiang River Bridge is a rail-cum-road double-pylon cable-stayed bridge with span arrangement (140+462+1092+462+140) m. The bridge is arranged into the double decks, of which the upper deck carries the highways while the lower deck carries the railways. The main girder of the bridge is the steel truss girder structure made up of three main trusses. The highway deck on the upper chords of the main girder is the integral orthotropic plate steel deck (in the 252 m ranges of the side spans on both sides, the highway deck is the structure composited by the stringers, cross beams and concrete deck slabs). The railway deck on the lower chords is formed by the steel box that has the same width with the cross section of the main girder. The decks on the upper and lower chords are all composited with the main trusses and contribute to the loading bearing of the whole structure of the main girder. The main trusses are the N-shape trusses, the members of the upper and lower chords are the box sections stiffened by the plate ribs and the web members are the box or H shape sections. The panel points of the main trusses are the all-welded integral panel points and at the panel points of the main trusses of the whole bridge, the lateral bracing systems are arranged. The whole structure is calculated, using the spatial analysis software 3D-bridge and the stress of the panel points is analyzed, using the software ANSYS. The results of the calculation and analysis demonstrate that the structural design of the main girder can satisfy the relevant requirements in the codes.
