Terminal heat stress is one of the limiting factors in wheat production and it is expected to rise under present scenario of climate change. The present study was conducted to evaluate the performance of 40 wheat genotypes under terminal heat stress conditions based on eight physiological traits. The plants were sown late (i.e. on 5th January) to expose them terminal heat stress. The genotypes were evaluated using multivariate analysis viz. Ward’s method of hierarchical clusters analysis, discriminant analysis and principle component analysis. The genotypes were categorized into three groups namely tolerant, intermediate and sensitive. Tolerant genotypes like DBW 14, RAJ 3765, HD 2643 and HALNA performed physiologically better in terms of higher membrane stability index (MSI), chlorophyll content, photosynthesis rate (Pn), harvest index under heat stress conditions. Genotypes HD 2987, SHANGHAI, HD 2402 and WH 730 were found to be heat sensitive. Physiological traits like MSI, SPAD value, Fv/Fm ratio and Pn were found to be most important contributor in grouping of genotypes and showed positive correlations (r) of 0.73, 0.47, 0.41 and 0.39 with grain yield, respectively, which is significant at p < 0.05. The large genetic diversity was found among the genotypes based on physiological traits. These genotypes can be utilized in wheat improvement programme for heat tolerance.
