This paper presents a performance of the open-graded asphalt concrete filled with a special cement grout in the road structures, introduces practical examples of the usage of this technology and defines the main properties. In addition, laboratory design of asphalt mixtures filled with special grout is researched. Finally, the results obtained from various laboratory tests are evaluated. The paper contains the open-graded asphalt concrete filled with a special cement grout mix design procedure and results of stiffness measurement, low temperature properties, permanent deformation and skid resistance. Open-graded asphalt concrete filled with a special cement grout mixture is compared to the com­monly used asphalt mixes. The open-graded asphalt concrete filled with a special cement grout showed better results than the commonly used asphalt mixes by the stiffness and resistance to the permanent deformation characteristics but behavior at the low temperatures is slightly problematic.
