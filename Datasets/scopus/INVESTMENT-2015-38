Government risk-sharing in foreign investment




 
Â© 1965 by Princeton University Press. All Rights Reserved. This book grew out of a Ph.D. dissertation written for Columbia University during 1960 and 1961. In 1964 the study was completely revised and brought up to date as of the end of 1963. The completion of this study has incurred more debts of gratitude than it is possible to enumerate. The greatest is to A. O. Hirschman, for his guidance and direction of both the conception and the execution of the original thesis. Peter Kenen, whose enlightening discussions helped more than once to cut through some particularly frustrating Gordian Knot, also has my deepest thanks.
