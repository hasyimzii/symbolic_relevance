Analysis of diffusion of grout in porous media considering infiltration effects




 
Â© 2015, Science Press. All right reserved. Infiltration effects exist widely in the process of turbid fluid seepage in porous media, and directly influence the diffusion and migration of the turbid fluid particles. In this paper, the movement of cement grout in porous media was studied based on the theoretical filtration effect model. Equations of grout movement incorporating the infiltration effects were established which are applicable for both constant rate and constant pressure grouting. A one-dimensional numerical model for the infiltration diffusion of grout was established. Compared to Darcy's law, the results show that the influence of infiltration effects on grout diffusion is significant. The influence of infiltration effects on the porosity of porous media, the grout concentration, and the grouting pressure distribution was further investigated to understand the interaction of infiltration effects with the grout diffusion and the effective range of grout reinforcement.
