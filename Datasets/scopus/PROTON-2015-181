Palladium-catalyzed ortho-nitration of 2-arylbenzoxazoles




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. An efficient and general protocol for palladium-catalyzed chelation-assisted ortho-nitration of 2-arylbenzoxazoles has been developed. This nitration exhibits high regioselectivity for the substrates, and the reaction could tolerate many functional groups such as F, Cl, Br, CH3, CH3O, affording ortho-nitration products in moderate to good yields. Moreover, some 2-arylbenzoxazole heterocyclic analogues proceed well under this catalytic system. Further studies have been performed to obtain insight into the mechanism.
