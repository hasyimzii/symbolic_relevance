Paleo-Asian oceanic subduction-related modification of the lithospheric mantle under the North China Craton: Evidence from peridotite xenoliths in the Datong basalts




 
© 2016 Elsevier B.V. In-situ major and trace elements and Sr isotopic compositions of peridotite xenoliths of the Datong Quaternary alkaline basalt were analyzed to evaluate the influences of the southward subduction of the Paleo-Asian oceanic plate (PAOP) on the lithospheric mantle transformation of the North China Craton (NCC). These peridotite xenoliths including spinel harzburgites and lherzolites were classified into three groups. The type 1 peridotites have the lowest temperatures (961-1007°C). Clinopyroxenes in these peridotites exhibit LREE-depleted REE patterns and have the lowest 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.70243-0.70411. The type 2 and 3 peridotites show higher temperatures (1017-1022°C). Clinopyroxenes in the type 2 peridotite have V-shaped REE patterns and relatively higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.70418-0.70465. Clinopyroxenes in the type 3 peridotite have concave-downward REE patterns and unusually high 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.70769-0.70929. Carbonatitic veinlets are found in the type 1 peridotites. They show steep LREE-enriched REE patterns with enrichment in LILE and depletion in HFSE, and have the highest 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.71145-0.71285.The mineral chemistries and modal calculations suggest that the protolith of these peridotites experienced a variable degree of partial melting. The type 2 and 3 peridotites sampled from deeper depth experienced latter cryptic carbonatitic metasomatism. The carbonatitic veinlets have generally consistent trace element patterns and Sr isotopic ratios with the calculated melts equilibrated with clinopyroxenes in the type 3 peridotite, which may represent the percolated carbonatitic melt quickly solidified in the relatively cold and shallow mantle. The remarkable negative Eu anomalies (0.37-0.61) and highly radiogenic Sr isotopic compositions of the calculated metasomatic agents preclude indicate melt derived from carbonated peridotite or carbonated eclogite but point to a crustal sedimentary origin. Considering the tectonic setting and geophysical research, it is speculated that the carbonatitic melt was derived from the carbonated pelite carried by the southward subducted PAOP under the NCC. The PAOP subduction-related carbonatitic melt-peridotite reaction could have contributed to the transformation of the lithospheric mantle beneath the northern margin of the NCC.
