Mud diapirism in the central Colombian caribbean coastal zone




 
Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. All rights reserved. The western part of the Colombian Caribbean coast is associated with Cenozoic accretionary prisms and influenced by mud diapirism, originated by density contrast between high-pressure muddy mass material containing gases and denser surrounding overburden, and by tectonic compression associated with oblique plate convergence. Mud diapirism surface manifestations are associated with land risings and differential tilting, locally called "mud volcanoes," land mudflows, mud, and intermittent gas bubbles and accumulation of mud on the surface. These manifestations have been considered as curious and picturesque phenomena. However, paroxysmal phases constitute a geologic risk for the inhabitants and the infrastructure of the region. The region of Cartagena displays numerous examples of these phenomena and deserves a visit by the scientific community which will also appreciate the beauty of this well-preserved colonial city.
