Using the analog and digital P and S wave data of 254 events from January 2001 to June 2013, we obtained the wave velocity ratio with the multi-station method and got the mean value for every earthquake. This study analyzes the spatial variation of the wave velocity ratios of Jilin area. To ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculated results, we carefully winnow the collected data and the calculated results. Our results show that there are strong lateral heterogeneity and difference between the south and north of Jilin area. The wave velocity ratio in the north part of Yitong-Shulan Fault shows strong lateral heterogeneity, the orientation of anomaly area for high and low wave velocity is in accordance with the NE-trending Fuyu-Zhaodong Fault; The high wave velocity ratio areas in the south part of Yitong-Shulan Fault mainly concentrate in the volcanic region, the wave velocity ratio in the southwest is little higher than that in the north part of Changbai Mountains volcanoes, suggesting that the low velocity abnormal body maybe locates in the southwest under Changbai Mountains, The study suggests that the high value zone and the transitional zone of high to low value are earthquake-prone zone by analyzing the distribution characteristic of wave velocity ratio and the earthquake activity.
