Designing Drug Conjugates Based on Sugar Decorated V-Shape and Star Polymethacrylates: Influence of Composition and Architecture of Polymeric Carrier




 
© 2015 American Chemical Society. Amphiphilic ethylenediamine (EDA)-functionalized V-shape and star copolymers with centrally placed methyl-α,d-glucopyranoside were designed as nanocarriers. Anticancer doxorubicin (DOX) was conjugated in water via amine groups in copolymers to form ketimine linkers. Variations of arm length and number (40-65 units per arm and 2 vs 3 vs 4 arms), DOX feed amount, and conjugation site content (50-160 units of EDA groups), as responsible for efficiency of drug attachment (10-60 units of conjugated DOX) and its release at various pH (5.0 vs 7.4), were studied to demonstrate potential for drug delivery. Size of conjugate particles (10-195 nm) formed in aqueous solution was strongly dependent on the polymer composition and topology. The broad range of drug amounts (25-95%) were detected by the precipitation method, showing pH sensitivity by some polymeric conjugates with faster DOX release in acidic conditions.
