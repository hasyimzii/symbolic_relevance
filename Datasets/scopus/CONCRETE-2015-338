The French contractors FRANÇOIS-MARTIN LEBRUN and FRANÇOIS COIGNET are generally considered "fathers" of modern concrete, particularly with a view to bridge building. However, when they embarked on their careers, they were already able to draw on considerable previous French experiences. The present article, the last one of a series of papers dedicated to the early history of concrete, puts the well-known achievements of LEBRUN, COIGNET and others in context. The paper also traces the development of concrete between rough rubble-cement masonry and real concrete in the modern sense. For all the different variants of concrete vaulting and bridge building, the article spans the entire scope from early notices in contemporary publications, to preserved monuments, including some little-known examples.
