A new incremental neural network for simultaneous clustering and classification




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. In this paper, an Incremental Neural Network for Classification and Clustering (INNCC) is proposed. The main advantages of this neural network are the linkage between data topology preservation and classes representation by using the cluster posterior probabilities of classes. It is a constructive model without prior conditions such as a suitable number of nodes. A new neuron is inserted when new data are not represented by existing neurons. In training step, both supervised and unsupervised learning are used. The training dataset contains few samples with class labels and several unlabeled ones. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) operates in the training step to assess the INNCC classification result. The proposed approach has been tested on synthetic and real datasets. Obtained results are very promising.
