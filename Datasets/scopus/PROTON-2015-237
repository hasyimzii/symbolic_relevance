Sesquiterpenoids and further diterpenoids from the rare Chloranthaceae plant Chloranthus sessilifolius




 
© 2015 Taylor & Francis. Two new dimeric lindenane-type sesquiterpenoids (1 and 2, named chlorasessilifols A and B, resp.), one new ent-podocarpane-type C17 norditerpenoid (3), and one new ent-torarane-type diterpenoid (4), along with seven known terpenoids, were isolated from the whole plant of Chloranthus sessilifolius. The new structures were established by means of spectroscopic methods and/or observed cotton effects in the circular dichroism spectra. Among the isolates, 3α,7β-dihydroxy-ent-abieta-8,11,13-triene (11) exhibited significant anti-neuroinflammatory activity by inhibiting the nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated murine BV-2 microglial cells, with an IC50 value of 4.3 M.
