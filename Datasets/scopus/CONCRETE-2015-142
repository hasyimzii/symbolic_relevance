Recently, with the rapid development of wind power industry, prestressed concrete-steel hybrid wind turbine tower possess many advantages for wind turbine towers with increasing power. The design of the connection between the prestressed concrete and steel tubular is important for the whole prestressed concrete-steel hybrid wind turbine tower. In this paper, a new connection method is proposed at first and its feasibility is studied numerically by finite element method for a 77.5m hybrid wind turbine tower structure. The elastic and plastic analysis on the connection are carried out and the stress and strain distributions on the concrete, prestress cable, steel tubular, the connection flange and the strip are obtained under design loads including moment, shear and axial loads. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed method overcome the non-uniform distribution of concrete stress and the overpass of lateral tensile stress, and the stress distribution of the connection under the way of new steel connection is within the scope of design strengthen. The proposed connection method may provide a promising way for the design of the connection of the prestressed concrete-steel hybrid wind turbine tower.
