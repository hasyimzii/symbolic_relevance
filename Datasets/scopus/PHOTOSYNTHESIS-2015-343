Synthetic Model of the Oxygen-Evolving Center: Photosystem II under the Spotlight




 
Â© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. The oxygen-evolving center (OEC) in photosystem II catalyzes a water splitting reaction. Great efforts have already been made to artificially synthesize the OEC, in order to elucidate the structure-function relationship and the mechanism of the reaction. Now, a new synthetic model makes the best mimic yet of the OEC. This recent study opens up the possibility to study the mechanism of photosystem II and photosynthesis in general for applications in renewable energy and synthetic biology.
