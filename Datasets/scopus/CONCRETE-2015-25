Optimizing pervious concrete pavement mixture design by using the Taguchi method




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Pervious concrete is a sustainable pavement with high permeability. The purpose of this study is to evaluate physical and mechanical properties of the pervious concrete including density, strength, porosity, and permeability. Taguchi design of experiments was used to optimize the performance of these characteristics. The relationship between properties dependent on coarse aggregate size. As the maximum size of the coarse aggregate increases, both the permeability and porosity grows up. Also, it results in a significant decrease in compressive strength. There is a trade-off between strength and permeability which should be considered to meet the minimum requirements for the pervious concrete.
