Higher education funding: The value of information




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. This note examines the key role of information about individual skills in economic welfare. In the model, agents invest in higher education when the returns to their investment are uncertain. They choose how to finance their investment on the basis of a public signal about their individual skills. This note provides an example of an economic framework in which, in equilibrium, more information about individual skills (more accurate signals) makes economic agents worse off.
