Based on the experimental study, using finite element analysis software, the reasonable constitutive relations of materials are chosen, a finite element analysis model of PVC-CFRP confined reinforced concrete column is established, the analysis model is verified by experiment results. Further studies are carried out, the effects of concrete strength, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, layer of CFRP strips and shear span ratio on the skeleton curves and the rigidity degradation are discussed, The mechanical behavior of PVC-CFRP confined reinforced concrete column is analyzed under low frequency cyclic load, and the working mechanism of PVC-CFRP confined reinforced concrete column is revealed under low frequency cyclic load.
