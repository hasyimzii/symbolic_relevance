Geochronological and geochemical implications of Early to Middle Jurassic continental adakitic arc magmatism in the Korean Peninsula




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) zircon U-Pb ages and whole-rock chemical compositions of Early to Middle Jurassic plutons from the central to southern Korean Peninsula are reported to investigate the effect of paleo-Pacific plate subduction preserved along the continental margin. Twenty-one plutonic rocks from the Yeongnam massif (i.e., Sunchang and Namwon plutons), the Okcheon belt (Jeongup, Boeun, and Mungyeong plutons), the northeast (Gangreung pluton), and the Gyeonggi massif (Gonam, Anheung, and Ganghwa plutons) have age ranges from ca. 189-186Ma to 177Ma, 177-166Ma, and 177-173Ma, respectively. Most plutonic rocks have chemical compositions similar to adakites, showing high SiO2 (45.62-74.96wt.%), low MgO (0.01-2.84wt.%), high Na2O (2.65-4.83wt.%), high Sr/Y and La/Yb, low Y and Yb, as well as low HFSEs (Nb and Ta), but initial Sr ratios (0.7048-0.7262), K2O (0.50-5.88wt.%), and K2O/Na2O (0.34-2.1) were unlikely to have been formed by melting of either a thickened and/or delaminated lower continental crust, or an altered oceanic crust. These suggest that the "adakitic" plutonic rocks in this region resulted from partial melting of an enriched mantle source metasomatized by dewatering from a delaminated flat-slab. The spatial distributions of this continental adakitic plutonic belt, based on the present study, together with previously reported geochronological results, indicate that magmatic pulses gradually migrated toward the continent across the Korean Peninsula as a result of slab shallowing caused by periodic slab buckling. The similar geochronological and geochemical characteristics, petrogenesis and tectonic setting of the plutonic belt spanning the Korean Peninsula, Japan, eastern China, and eastern Russia indicate a possible link to an active subduction system that existed during the Early to Middle Jurassic, although the products of the plate subduction might differ in different locations along the East Asian continental margin.
