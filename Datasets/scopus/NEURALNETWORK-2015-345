Adaptive test system of student knowledge based on neural networks




 
Â© 2015 IEEE. An information adaptive test system of student's knowledge was proposed. It is based on the three-criterion decision-making model of transferring between the test difficulties levels using neural network. Knowledge check results in the groups of students studying in the distance learning system Moodle were compared with knowledge check results groups of students who were trained using the improved EduPRO system. This comparison, based on experimental data confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
