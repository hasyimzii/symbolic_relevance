Cloning, characterization and anion inhibition studies of a γ-carbonic anhydrase from the Antarctic cyanobacterium Nostoc commune




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. We report the cloning and catalytic activity of a γ-carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) isolated from the Antarctic cyanobacterium Nostoc commune, NcoCA. The enzyme has a significant catalytic activity for the physiologic reaction, CO2 hydration to bicarbonate and protons, with a kcat of 9.5 × 105 s-1 and a kcat/Km of 8.3 × 107 M-1 × s-1, being the most catalytically efficient γ-CA investigated so far. An anion inhibition study of NcoCA with inorganic/organic anions is also reported here. Fluoride, sulfate, perchlorate and tetrafluoroborate did not inhibit appreciably NcoCA, whereas the other halides, pseudohalides, bicarbonate, nitrate, nitrite and many complex inorganic anions showed inhibition in the millimolar range. The best NcoCA inhibitors detected so far were diethyldithiocarbamate (KI of 0.80 mM) as well as sulfamide, sulfamate, phenylboronic acid and phenylarsonic acid (KIs in the range of 70-90 μM). Since γ-CAs are present in carboxysomes, being involved in photosynthesis, this study may be relevant for a better understanding of such processes in some Antarctic organisms.
