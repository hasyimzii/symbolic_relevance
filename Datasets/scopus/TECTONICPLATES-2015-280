Neoarchean subduction: A case study of arc volcanic rocks in Qinglong-Zhuzhangzi area of the Eastern Hebei Province, North China Craton




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. We report on volcanic rocks of the Qinglong-Zhuzhangzi area in northeastern Eastern Hebei Province, North China Craton. The supracrustal rock associations in the study area consist of amphibole/biotite plagioclase gneiss, mica (plagioclase) gneiss/schist, biotite K-feldspar gneiss, (pyroxene) plagioclase amphibolite and amphibolite. Twenty-five new mafic, intermediate to felsic samples can be geochemically classified into four groups. Group 1 is similar to fore arc low Ti tholeiite and is characterized by low SiO2 (49.7wt%) and TiO2 (0.43wt%), slightly depleted LREE and MREE pattern with (La/Yb)N ratio of 0.74, (Gd/Yb)N ratio of 0.82. It most likely derived from depleted mantle in a subduction initiation environment. Group 2 is akin to primitive arc tholeiites with low SiO2 (49.7-51.8wt%), slight enrichments of LREE ((La/Sm)N: 1.06-1.53) and negative Nb anomalies ((Nb/La)PM: 0.50-0.76). Group 3 resembles evolved arc tholeiites and displays pronounced enrichments of LREE ((La/Yb)N of 2.38-11.3, (La/Sm)N of 1.70-2.86) and negative Nb, Ta anomalies ((Nb/La)PM: 0.14-0.34, except sample 11JD28-4 with that ratio of 1.00). Group 2 and 3 formed by partial melting of sub-arc depleted mantle wedge modified by differing quantities of slab flux addition. Group 4 comprises K-rich andesite-dacites, which are distinguished by the highest SiO2 (54.0-71.8wt%), K contents (up to 5.03wt%), strong enrichments of LREE ((La/Yb)N ratios of 4.83-19) and negative Nb-Ta anomalies, analogous to shoshonitic rocks marking late stage of subduction.LA-ICPMS zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf analyses of evolved arc basalts and K-rich andesite-dacites display crystallization ages of 2511-2604. Ma and single stage Hf model ages of 2534-2927. Ma (most focus on 2650-2800. Ma). In contrast to ~2510-2560. Ma arc associations, ~2604. Ma shoshonitic dacites most plausibly represent an older orogenic event. Collectively, supracrustal rocks in the Qinglong-Zhuzhangzi area constitute a series of volcanic arc associations that correspond to an entire subduction cycle ranging from orogen to primitive arc-evolved arc and back to an orogenic setting, which further demonstrate that, by the late Archean, plate tectonic and subduction processes already closely resembled modern counterparts.
