Azine and Diazine Functionalization Using 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidino-Based Lithium-Metal Combinations: Application to the Synthesis of 5,9-Disubstituted Pyrido[3′,2′:4,5]pyrrolo[1,2- c ]pyrimidines




 
© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart · New York-Synlett 2015. The synthesis of triaryl methanols was investigated by reacting different 4-metalated 2-substituted pyrimidines with diaryl ketones, the latter being generated by deprotocupration-aroylation of azine and diazine substrates. Cyclization of the triaryl methanols thus obtained afforded pyrido[3′,2′:4,5]pyrrolo[1,2-c]pyrimidines, which were evaluated for kinase inhibition and antiproliferative activities in melanoma cells.
