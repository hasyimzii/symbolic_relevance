Sodium dodecylsulphate-catalyzed hetero-aromatic nitrogen base-promoted chromium(VI) oxidation of 2-propenol to 2-propenal in aqueous media




 
Â© Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015. A kinetic study of homogeneously micelle-catalyzed, hetero-aromatic Nbase (2-picolinic acid, 2,2'-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline)-promoted oxidation of 2-propenol by chromium(VI) in sulfuric acid medium was carried out at 303 K. The pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) of the oxidation reaction is directly proportional to [H+] and [promoters], which indicates that the reaction is first order with respect to H+ and promoters. The reaction was conducted at four different temperatures from which the activation parameters were calculated. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) studies were performed to detect the location of reactant molecules in nanometersized micelles. From the observed kinetic results, a suitable mechanism consistent with the rate law has been proposed. The micelles produced a catalytic effect in the entire range of sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) concentrations used, and the effect is explained by pseudo-phase ion exchange. The combination of 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy) and SDS exhibited a 15-fold rate enhancement of Cr(VI) oxidation of 2-propenol to 2-propenal.
