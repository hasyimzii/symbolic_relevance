In its simplest form, it can be said that the resistance to separation of mortar and concrete from reinforcing steel (or other materials) with which it is in contact is called bond strength. These days different kinds of concrete are manufactured, all with different properties. But bond strength is something which is essentially a well sort after quality for any RCC structure or element. Bond strength can be easily found out by standard pull-out test machine. But in this work, the bond strength was measured using Universal testing machine (UTM) with some modified arrangements. The bond between the concrete and steel reinforcement was investigated for two different kinds of concretes. Using reinforcing bars bond strengths were measured using Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) specimen and Normal Cement Concrete (NCC) specimen. Castings of SCC specimens were carried out without compaction, while the normal concrete specimens were casted with substantial compaction and vibration. The study revealed that SCC specimens generated higher bond to reinforcing bars in comparison with NCC specimens. Secondly, the correlation between bond strength and compressive strength of NCC is more consistent. Thirdly, the results obtained with UTM were compared with the results obtained with standard pull-out test machine and they were found in permissible limits.
