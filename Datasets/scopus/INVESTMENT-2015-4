Crowdfunding: Online charity or a modern tool for innovative projects implementation?




 
Â© 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education. All rights reserved. Crowdfunding is a promising field of financing high-risk innovative projects. The start-up developers raise money needed for their start-up implementation on a crowdfunding-platform by means of the Internet. The investors may also include ordinary citizens who wish to support this or that original idea and contribute to its implementation. The possibility of access to a completely new product (and before the official sales) is the main motive for financing projects.
