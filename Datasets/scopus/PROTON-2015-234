Enantioselective Synthesis of ((1 R,2 R)-Cyclohexane-1,2-diyl)bis(methylene)dimethanesulfonate, a Lurasidone Hydrochloride Intermediate




 
Â© 2015 Dr. Reddys Laboratories. A concise, economical, and highly enantioselective synthesis of bismesylate intermediate of lurasidone HCl, an antipsychotic, has been developed. The key steps involved in the synthesis are thionyl chloride-catalyzed esterification of tetrahydrophthalic anhydride in MeOH, epimerization of cis to trans isomer, hydrolysis of the diester, resolution of the diacid, reduction with Red-Al, and finally bismesylation of the corresponding diol, which provided the desired intermediate ((1 R,2 R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diyl)bis(methylene) dimethanesulfonate in overall good yield.
