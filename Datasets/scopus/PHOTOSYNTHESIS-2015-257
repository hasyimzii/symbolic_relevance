Recent advances in the application of chlorophyll a fluorescence from photosystem II




 
Â© 2014 The American Society of Photobiology. In the photosynthesis process, part of the absorbed photon energy in photosystem II (PSII) may be reemitted as chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF). Environmental and plant physiological changes affect the emission of ChlF, which makes ChlF a potentially useful tool to sense these changes. Volumes of research on ChlF are published each year and some published work has been controversial. To facilitate the application of ChlF, it is important to have a holistic picture of the field. This review summarizes ChlF applications published in the last 10 years.
