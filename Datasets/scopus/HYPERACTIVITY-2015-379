ADHD in adulthood: Diagnostics and therapy | [ADHS im Erwachsenenalter: Diagnostik und Therapie]




 
Â© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Traditionally, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was assumed to be a childhood disorder. In the meantime a persistence of symptoms into adulthood has been shown in 60 % of those affected. Besides the core symptoms of inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsivity, adults with ADHD often suffer from comorbid disorders and functional impairment in multiple domains. In recent years diagnostic guidelines and standardized questionnaires have been developed, which facilitate the diagnostics of ADHD. In addition various therapeutic approaches have emerged and randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy. The aim of the article is to present the current standard of knowledge with respect to the diagnostics and treatment of ADHD.
