Effects of variations in the mix constituents of ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) on costand performance




 
Â© 2015 RILEM With the overall objective of minimizing cost, this research experimentally investigates the effects of variations in the mix constituents of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) on its short term compressive and tensile behavior. The experimental variables are four different quantities of silica fume, three different quantities of silica powder, three different cement types (White Cement Type I, Portland Type V, GGBS/Portland Type I blend) and three different fiber volume contents (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 %) of straight, smooth, high strength steel fibers. Such low fiber volume fractions have been rarely investigated in the past and are selected in this work to broaden the knowledge base and promote lower material cost. Experimental results showed minor differences in mechanical behavior due to variations in the quantity of silica fume. Silica powder changes led to little difference in material behavior, suggesting that silica powder can be removed due to its high cost. UHPCs containing White Type I cement exhibited the best performance in almost all aspects of behavior including load carrying capacity, energy absorption capacity and multiple cracking behaviors, but carried the highest cost. Specimens containing the GGBS/Portland I binder showed lower performance, but at decreased cost. UHPC specimens containing 0.5 % fibers exhibited some strain hardening behavior, which became more pronounced as the fiber volume fraction increased. The results suggest that fiber volume contents of 1.0 or 1.5 % could significantly reduce the chance for crack localization under dead load or working conditions, respectively, in structural applications.
