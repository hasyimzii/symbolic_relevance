The effects of different ways of adding nano-TiO2 to concrete on the degradation performance of NO2




 
Â© 2015 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. Nano-titanium dioxide can absorb the nitrogen oxide in automobile exhaust when used in the materials of concrete roads, which has the effect of helping to degrade automobile exhaust. In this paper, different dosages of nano-TiO2 materials were experimentally put into a range of materials with adsorbent, dispersant and surface activity qualities, which can then act as carriers for the nano-TiO2; and these were then introduced into concrete in two different ways (incorporating and spraying). What's more, a multi-functional gas-solid phase photocatalytic degradation exhaust testing system was developed to control the environmental factors and thereby simulate road conditions indoors to test the degradation effect on NO2 exhaust pollutants. The results showed that nano-TiO2 had a good effect in the degradation of automobile exhaust and was also economical when introduced into concrete specimens by incorporation or spraying at 2 concentrations of 5 and 1%, respectively.
