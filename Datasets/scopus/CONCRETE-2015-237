Shear strength and structural behaviours of HPRWO with web openings with circular steel tubes




 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the shear strength and structural behavior of reinforced-concrete beams with web openings (hereinafter, "HPRWO"), where the web openings are reinforced with circular steel tubes. The experiments were conducted under the monotonic loading condition. Based on the structural experiments involving HPRWO, ultimate load ratio (d0,d0/h, etc.), ductility, load-deflection curve, and failure mode comparisons were made for evaluation purposes. This study utilized the design formula for predicting the shear strength proposed by the previous studies and formulas to determine the appropriate shear strength for HPRWO. The results of the experiments confirmed that the rigidity, ductility, and other properties of the HPRWO specimens reinforced with circular steel tubes, fiber, and admixtures were superior to those of the unreinforced HPRWOs. With Mansur's formula, a noticeable tendency for the increase in d0 and the sectional area of the web openings to lead to the overestimation of Vu/Vu,cal was found. The Vu/Vu,cal value was found to be more in line with the experiment results based on the AIJ formula compared with the results obtained using other formulas.
