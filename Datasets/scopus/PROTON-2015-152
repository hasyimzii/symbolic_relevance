Mono- and binuclear Pd(II) complexes with 2-(5,6-dimethyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)-N-phenylhydrazinecarbothioamide: Synthesis, crystal structure and spectroscopic characterization




 
© 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. Two novel Pd2+ mononuclear [Pd(HL)PPh3Cl]·nDMF (1) (n = 1, 2) and binuclear [Pd2(L)2(PPh3)2]·SPPh3·3DMF (2) complexes have been synthesized by reaction of [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2] with 2-(5,6-dimethyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)-N-phenylhydrazinecarbothioamide and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 has been additionally characterized by 1H NMR, IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. For the complex 1, two crystalline polymorphic modifications have been found: monoclinic (1a) and more stable triclinic (1b) one, which crystal structure differs by different crystal packing and number of lattice solvent molecules. In both polymorphs, the ligand molecules are coordinated as monoanion in thiol tautomeric form with transferring of thiosemicarbazide proton to nitrogen atom of thienopyrimidine moiety. In the case of complex 2, additional deprotonation of thienopyrimidine nitrogen atom leads to coordination of the ligand as dianion. The crystal structure of 2 also contains one molecule of triphenylphosphine sulfide formed by side reaction. In both complexes "soft" phosphorus atoms of triphenylphosphine molecules are coordinated in trans-positions to more "hard" nitrogen atoms.
