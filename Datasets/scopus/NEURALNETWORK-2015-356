Realization of the neural network model of prediction of the software project characteristics for evaluating the success of its implementation




 
Â© 2015 IEEE. This paper proves the dependence of successful of software project implementation on the software requirements specification (SRS), the actuality and importance of the skill to evaluate the possible success of software project based on the specifications. The neural network model of prediction of the software project characteristics for evaluating the success of its implementation based on analysis of specifications is first time proposed and implemented in Matlab.
