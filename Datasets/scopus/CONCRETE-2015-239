IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering




 
The proceedings contain 52 papers. The topics discussed include: influence of specimen size on autogenous volume deformation of concrete with magnesium oxide; experimental study on the microstructure evolution of 55SiMnMo; research on geometrical model and mechanism for metal deformation based on plastic flow; analysis of the influence of advanced materials for aerospace products R&D and manufacturing cost; a study on the influence of ultrasonic processing on microstructure during laser welding phases; effect of rapid set binder on early strength and permeability of HeS latex modified road repair prepacked concrete; facile synthesis of silver-tin oxide electrical contact materials by in-situ decomposition of a uniform mixture precursor; revealing the effect of electrode materials on the performance of low-voltage pentacene thin film transistor by in-situ surface potential measurement; and application of alcohol based spraying coating on green sand mould for steel casting.
