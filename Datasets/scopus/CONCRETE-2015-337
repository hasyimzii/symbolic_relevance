Reason analysis and treatment for concrete material cracks of tunnel lining




 
Â© 2015 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. In the construction of highway tunnels, the lining material is mainly composed of reinforced concrete. However, this lining concrete will crack if it does not have sufficient strength. Such cracks will aggravate internal reinforced material rust, impacting the tunnel's safety and waterproofness. Once a highway tunnel has been in operation for 2 years, cracks become apparent. To assess the cracks, highway tunnel construction was investigated, and the causes were analysed on convergence of tunnel section, material strength test and numerical simulation. Possible factors in the design, construction and operation stages were also researched, such as partial pressure; material strength and engineering geology. The concept of quality management in the whole process is proposed. In addition, it is crucial to choose the appropriate materials to reinforce in a timely manner, to avoid too much cracking and ensure long-term stability. The research results have great significance for the safety control and management of highway tunnels.
