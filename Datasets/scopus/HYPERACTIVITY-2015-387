Background: Previous studies have indicated that phthalate exposure may influence the development of children, but the current data are limited, and controversy remains regarding the sex-specific and age-specific effects of phthalate exposure. Methods: We investigated the sex- and age-specific associations of current phthalate exposure with neurobehavioral development scores in a nationally representative sample of 6-18-year-olds participating in the Korean Environmental Health Survey in Children and Adolescents (KorEHS-C). Neurobehavioral development was assessed using the Korean Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL, N = 1723) and the Korean Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ARS, N = 867). We measured the concentrations of phthalate metabolites in urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The associations between urine phthalate metabolite concentrations and neurobehavioral development were examined by survey regression analysis for complex sampling and penalized regression splines using a generalized additive model. Results: Survey regression analysis revealed that a higher mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) level was associated with social (β = 0.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.15-1.05), thought (0.55; 0.08-1.03), and attention (0.68; 0.21-1.14) problems on the CBCL. A significant association was found between the MnBP level and the ARS hyperactivity subscale score (0.42; 0.05-0.58). Higher levels of MnBP (0.87; 0.20-1.54), mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP, 0.61; 0.11-1.11) and mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP, 0.51; 0.04-0.97) were associated with an increase in thought problems among the girls. Among the younger children aged 6-11 years, significant positive associations between the MnBP (0.71; 0.09-1.33), MECPP (0.74, 0.14-1.34), MEOHP (0.65; 0.10-1.20), and MEHHP (0.71; 0.21-1.21) levels and social problems and between the MnBP (1.11; 0.37-1.84), MEOHP (0.64; 0.13-1.15), and MEHHP (0.66; 0.18-1.14) levels and attention problems were observed. The penalized regression splines for the age-specific relationships between the urinary MnBP, MEOHP, and MEHHP levels and social and attention problems exhibited positive supralinear relationships with downward curvature in the 6-11 year age group. In contrast, the score for social problems exhibited nearly linear relationships with these levels in the 12-18 year age group. Conclusions: In this national sample, increased phthalate exposure exhibited supralinear associations with social, thought and attention problems in children aged 6-11 years, who showed greater vulnerability to phthalate exposure. The results highlight the need for the environmental regulation of phthalate exposure in younger children, even at low dosages.
