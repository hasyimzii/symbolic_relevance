Study of the safety of methylphenidate: Focus on nephrotoxicity aspects




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc. Aims Methylphenidate (MPD) is increasingly prescribed for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and there are concerns about its appropriate use. Furthermore, little is known about the potential nephrotoxicity in patients using MPD. This study aimed to investigate the safety of MPD, with focus on the possible effects of this drug on renal function. Main methods We investigated the effects of MPD on renal perfusion system and renal tubular cells through in vivo and in vitro experimental models. Key findings In the in vivo experiments, 24 h and 48 h after MPD administration, urea, creatinine, creatinine clearance, and the fractional excretion of sodium and potassium were not changed. In the isolated kidney perfusion, MPD significantly reduced urinary flow, glomerular filtration rate and the percentage of tubular sodium transport. However, the perfusion pressure, renal vascular resistance and the percentage of tubular potassium transport were unchanged in this system. In the canine renal epithelial cell line MDCK culture, MPD was not cytotoxic and, in histopathological analysis, MPD did not promote alterations. Significance Our findings suggest a possible nephrotoxic effect of MPD, since it altered renal function by reducing the glomerular activity, urinary flow and sodium transport. These effects need to be further investigated in order to minimize potential harms associated with the use of MPD.
