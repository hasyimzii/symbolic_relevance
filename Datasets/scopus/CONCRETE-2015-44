Low-velocity flexural impact response of steel fiber reinforced concrete subjected to freeze-thaw cycles in NaCl solution




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. The flexural impact responses of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) with freeze-thaw cycles in 3.0% NaCl solution were investigated in this paper. Freeze-thaw cycles were carried out and followed by the flexural impact test. The weight loss and the residual strain of SFRC were measured, respectively. The results show that 1.5% (by volume) steel fibers addition has a little effect on the weight loss of concrete subjected to the freeze-thaw cycles in 3.0% NaCl solution. Both the bottom and side residual strain increase with the increasing of flexural impact test. For SFRC subjected to 0, 100, 150, 200 freeze-thaw cycles, the relationships between the residual strain and the number of impact test can be fitted by exponential functions with a good correlation coefficient. The effect of freeze-thaw cycles in 3.0% NaCl solution on the initial impact strength is slight. However, the initial impact strength decreases obviously after SFRC specimens are subjected to 250 freeze-thaw cycles.
