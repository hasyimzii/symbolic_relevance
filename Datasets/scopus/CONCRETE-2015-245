Seismic behavior of hybrid fiber reinforced cementitious composite beam-column joints




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. This paper presents the experimental results of six exterior beam-column joints with different concrete composites under cyclic loading. Engineered cementitious composite with polypropylene fiber and hybrid cementitious composites (HCC) using three different types of fiber namely hooked end steel fiber; brass coated steel fiber and polypropylene fiber are explored in this study. The hysteresis behavior, ductility response, energy dissipation with damping characteristics, crack patterns and damage index of all tested specimens are analyzed and compared with the cyclic response of conventional specimens. The test results indicate that HCC increases load carrying capacity and enhances energy dissipation with increased stiffness retention over conventional specimens. At higher rotation, joint specimens with HCC manifest better damage tolerance capacity over conventional specimens. This investigation implies that the use of HCC in the joint region may be an alternative solution to significantly increase the shear capacity, damage tolerance capacity and member ductility.
