Study on propylene polymerization in the presence of phenolic antioxidant (Irganox 1076) and characterization of stabilized polymers




 
Â© 2014 Society of Plastics Engineers. The aim of this study was to investigate different concentrations of Irganox 1076 on Ziegler-Natta catalyst performance during propylene polymerization. Antioxidant masking was conducted by addition of different molar ratio of triethylaluminum (TEAL). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra confirmed the complete conversion of antioxidant to aluminum aryloxide form. The different concentrations of masked antioxidant with different molar ratio of TEAL were used during polymerization and the catalyst activity was evaluated. Morphology, particle size distribution, melt temperature, crystallization temperature, degree of crystallinity, oxidative induction time, and isotacticity of products in the presence of masked antioxidant were evaluated. Results showed that incomplete masking of OH phenolic antioxidant led to significant catalyst activity reduction. J. VINYL ADDIT. TECHNOL., 21:285-289, 2015.
