Investigation on the effect of supplementary cementitious materials on the critical chloride threshold of steel in concrete




 
Â© 2015 RILEM The critical chloride threshold is a key parameter in the service life design of reinforced concrete structures exposed to chloride-bearing environments. This paper investigates the role of concrete composition, and particularly the effect of supplementary cementing materials, on the chloride threshold. To simulate real exposure conditions, ponding tests were carried out on reinforced concrete specimens with bars in free corrosion conditions and corrosion initiation was detected through corrosion potential and corrosion rate measurements. After two and a half years, the ponding was followed by an ageing period and the initiation of corrosion was further detected with anodic potentiostatic polarisation tests. Results of the tests showed several limitations of the approach based on chloride penetration and monitoring of free corrosion parameters to investigate the chloride threshold. In spite of this, a possible role of natural pozzolan and coal fly ash additions in leading to higher values of the chloride threshold and ground limestone in promoting lower values of the chloride threshold could be observed.
