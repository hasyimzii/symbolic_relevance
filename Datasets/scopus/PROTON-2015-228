Selective cytotoxic eremophilane-type sesquiterpenes from Penicillium citreonigrum




 
© 2015 Taylor & Francis. One new eremophilane-type sesquiterpene (1, citreopenin) was isolated from Penicillium citreonigrum (HQ738282), and the structure was elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic data interpretation and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kα radiation (CCDC 1030588). Compound 1 showed weak activity against KB-VIN (IC50 = 11.0 ± 0.156 M), while the known compound 3 exhibited selective cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (IC50 = 5.42 ± 0.167 M)
