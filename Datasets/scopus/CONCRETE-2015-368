It is possible to remove large sensible internal heat gains solely by radiant cooling systems if large areas of internal surface can be activated for radiant cooling. The ventilation system then only has to supply the small amount of fresh air required by standards to provide a healthy indoor environment. This paper reports on experimental analyses evaluating the dynamic behavior of a test room equipped with a radiant cooling system composed of plastic capillary tubes integrated into the inner layer of sandwich wall elements made of high performance concrete. The influence of the radiant cooling system on the indoor climate of the test room in terms of the air, surface and operative temperatures and velocities was investigated. The results show that the temperature of the room air can be kept in a comfortable range using cooling water for the radiant cooling system with a temperature only about 4 K lower than the temperature of the room air. The relatively high speed reaction of the designed system is a result of the slim construction of the sandwich wall elements made of high performance concrete.
