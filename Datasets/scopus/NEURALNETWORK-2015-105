Material classification and semantic segmentation of railway track images with deep convolutional neural networks




 
Â© 2015 IEEE. The condition of railway tracks needs to be periodically monitored to ensure passenger safety. Cameras mounted on a moving vehicle such as a hi-rail vehicle or a geometry inspection car can generate large volumes of high resolution images. Extracting accurate information from those images has been challenging due to background clutter in railroad environments. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to visual track inspection using material classification and semantic segmentation with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). We show that DCNNs trained end-to-end for material classification are more accurate than shallow learning machines with hand-engineered features and are more robust to noise. Our approach results in a material classification accuracy of 93.35% using 10 classes of materials. This allows for the detection of crumbling and chipped tie conditions at detection rates of 86.06% and 92.11%, respectively, at a false positive rate of 10 FP/mile on the 85-mile Northeast Corridor (NEC) 2012-2013 concrete tie dataset.
