Synergistic Combination Chemotherapy of Camptothecin and Floxuridine through Self-Assembly of Amphiphilic Drug-Drug Conjugate




 
Â© 2015 American Chemical Society. Combination chemotherapy has been widely applied in cancer treatment; however, the cocktail administration of combination chemotherapy could cause the nonuniform biodistribution of anticancer agents, thus impairing the therapeutic efficacy. In the present study, to address this concern, we proposed a novel strategy of preparing self-assembled nanoparticles from amphiphilic drug-drug conjugate for synergistic combination chemotherapy. The conjugate was synthesized by two-step esterification of hydrophobic camptothecin (CPT) and hydrophilic floxuridine (FUDR) through a linker compound. Because of its amphiphilic nature, the CPT-FUDR conjugate self-assembled into stable nanoparticles which could simultaneously release fixed dosage of the two drugs in cancer cells. In vitro studies demonstrated synergistic anticancer efficacy of the CPT-FUDR nanoparticles including improved cell apoptosis, varied cell cycle arrest, as well as effective inhibition of cancer cell proliferation.
