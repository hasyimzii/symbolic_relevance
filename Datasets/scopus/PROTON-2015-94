Total Synthesis of (-)-Enigmazole A




 
Â© 2015 American Chemical Society. A highly convergent, stereocontrolled total synthesis of the architecturally complex marine sponge metabolite (-)-enigmazole A has been achieved. Highlights include an unprecedented late-stage large-fragment Petasis-Ferrier union/rearrangement, a multicomponent Type I Anion Relay Chemistry (ARC) tactic, and a dithiane-epoxide union in conjunction with an oxazole-directed stereoselective reduction.
