The repeated load tests of five recycled coarse aggregate concrete composite beams and two normal concrete composite beams were carried out to investigate the flexural behavior of recycled coarse aggregate concrete composite beams with closed-section steel deck. Based on the tests, the flexural behavior of recycled coarse aggregate concrete composite beams with different shear studs' layout, slab thickness and steel shape was analyzed and compared with that of normal concrete composite beams. The analysis working was mainly focused on yield load, ultimate load, deformation, the slippage between the steel shape and composite slab and damage process of the composite beams during the test. The test results show that the failure modes of recycled coarse aggregate concrete composite beams and normal concrete composite beams are similar. Based on the experimental results, the calculating formulas of the bearing capacity and the deformation of recycled coarse aggregate concrete composite beams with closed-section steel deck were presented with reference to the normal concrete composite structure design code. The calculating results are in good agreement with that of the experimental results, so the calculating formulas can be used for designing recycled coarse aggregate concrete composite beams.
