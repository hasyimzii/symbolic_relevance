A chemically non-innocent pyrrole-based trianionic (ONO)3- pincer ligand within [(pyr-ONO)TiCl(thf)2] (2) can access the dianionic [(3H-pyr-ONO)TiCl2(thf)] (1-THF) and monoanionic [(3H,4H-pyr-ONO)TiCl2(OEt2)][B{3,5-(CF3)2C6H3}4] (3-Et2O) states through remote protonation of the pyrrole γ-C π-bonds. The homoleptic [(3H-pyr-ONO)2Zr] (4) was synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy in solution. The protonation of 4 by [H(OEt2)2][B{C6H3(CF3)2}4] yields [(3H,4H-pyr-ONO)(3H-pyr-ONO)Zr][B{3,5-(CF3)2C6H3}4] (5), thus demonstrating the storage of three protons.
