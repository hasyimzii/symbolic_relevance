The Tiansheng Port special ship channel bridge of the Hutong Changjiang River Bridge is a flexible arch bridge with three-span continuous rigid girder with span arrangement (140+336+140) m. The foundation for the main pier No. 3 of the bridge is the bored piles with embedded pile cap in deepwater and is constructed by the double-wall steel cofferdam that is 58.1 m long, 28.1 m wide and 20.6 m high. In the construction, the cofferdam was integrally manufactured and assembled in two lifts (the lower lift being 14.8 m and the upper lift being 5.8 m high) in a shipyard nearby the bridge site, was transported to the pier site by the floating crane and flat barge, lowered into the river in each lift and height extended by the floating crane and was finally sunk in place by the method of mud dredging aided by mud grabbing. The base sealing concrete for the cofferdam was cast in one time from the upstream to the downstream sides of the cofferdam, using a number of the tremie ducts, central concrete hopper and dumping of the concrete from the agitators. The inspection of the completed base sealing of the cofferdam found no problem of the water leakage and the construction quality could meet the design requirements.
