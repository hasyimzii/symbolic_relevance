Synthesis of Silylcyclopropanes through the Catalytic Generation of Zinc Silylcarbenoids from Enynones




 
© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart · New York. A simple methodology for the preparation of 1-furyl-1-(silyl)cyclopropanes is reported. ZnCl2 serves as inexpensive, low-toxicity catalyst for the generation of silylcarbenes from enynones, which can be trapped by alkenes under mild reaction conditions. These cyclopropanations take place in high yields and selectivities, showing a remarkable scope.
