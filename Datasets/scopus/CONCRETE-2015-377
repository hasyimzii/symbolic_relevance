Effect of recycled materials and compaction methods on the mechanical properties and solar reflectance index of pervious concrete




 
This research project evaluated the effect of using recycled aggregate and ground granulated slag on pervious concrete specimens compacted using two different methods: fixed energy and fixed porosity. The permeability, compressive strength, and solar reflectance index were analyzed. When compacted to a fixed target porosity of 20%, mixtures using recycled aggregate had, on average, 12% less strength than virgin aggregate mixtures. The use of slag did not negatively affect permeability, or compressive strength and yet was useful in improving the solar reflectance index in mixtures made with limestone aggregate. Recycled aggregate mixtures exhibited a significantly higher solar reflectance index compared to the mixtures using virgin aggregates.
