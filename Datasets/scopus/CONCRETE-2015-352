In order to obtain the resistance equations of high-velocity projectile penetration into concrete targets, a dynamic spherical cavity-expansion model based on cap model is proposed. The general dynamic response expressions of concrete, which are applied to all kinds of spherical cavity expansion model, are obtained by describing the dynamic mechanical behaviors of concrete material with general equation of state and yield criterion. Yield softening properties of concrete under high pressure are considered in the proposed cavity expansion model by introducing the Drucker-Prager cap model. The calculated results show that the resistance equations of high velocity stage derived using Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion with shear saturation and Tresca criterion are great different from those derived using the cap model. The predictions obtained from the cap model are in good agreement with experimental data.
