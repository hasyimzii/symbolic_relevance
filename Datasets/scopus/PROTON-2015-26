Fluorescence Up-Conversion Studies of [2,2′-Bipyridyl]-3,3′-diol in Octyl-β- d -glucoside and Other Micellar Aggregates




 
© 2015 American Chemical Society. In this present work, excited state double proton transfer dynamics (ESIDPT) of 2,2′-bipyridyl-3,3′-diol (BP(OH)2) molecules has been probed in a nontoxic, biocompatible sugar surfactant assembly, namely, octyl-β-d-glucoside (OBG) micelle with the help of steady state and fluorescence up-conversion techniques. Moreover, the ultrafast double proton transfer dynamics in conventional micelles (SDS, CTAB) and bile salts aggregates have been probed and compared. Interestingly, in all these supramolecular aggregates, the ESIDPT dynamics is found to follow sequential pathway; however, the time-scale of proton transfer dynamics varies from 11 to 30 ps. This difference in proton transfer time scale in different supramolecular aggregates has been explained in terms of accessibility of water molecules in the vicinity of probe.
