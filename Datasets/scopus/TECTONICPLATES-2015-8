Superposed deformation in the Helanshan Structural Belt: Implications for Mesozoic intracontinental deformation of the North China Plate




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. The North China Plate (NCP) underwent multi-phase intracontinental deformation during the Mesozoic, which is a much-debated research subject. Here we present a case study of this deformation inferred from regional-scale Helanshan superposed folds in the west of the NCP. New structural analyses and fault kinematic analyses in the Helanshan Structural Belt (HSB) indicate a two-stage syn-folding paleo-stress field, comprising early NNE-SSW compression, with mean orientations 190°/01° (plunge direction/plunge) for σ1, 283°/26° for σ2, and 100°/63° for σ3, and later WNW-ESE compression with mean orientations of σ1, σ2, and σ3 at 124°/07°, 213°/04°, and 001°/75°, respectively. These results, combined with geochronological analysis, indicate two episodes of shortening in this belt during the Mesozoic. Late Triassic-Early Jurassic NNE-SSW shortening, which produced ~8.1km of horizontal shortening, led to the development of open WNW-trending fold structures. Subsequent Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous WNW-ESE shortening, which produced ~18.7km of horizontal shortening, reshaped the early WNW-trending structures and generated close, overprinting NNE-trending folds that resulted in the development of the regional-scale superposed folds in this area. In terms of geodynamics, the early NNE-SSW shortening is likely to be related to Indosinian intercontinental convergence between the North China Plate and the Yangtze Plate, and the later WNW-ESE shortening is likely to have been related to subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. The regional structural analysis indicates that the whole of the western North China Plate experienced two-phase contractional deformation during the Mesozoic, as manifest by the early NNE-SSW and the late WNW-ESE shortening that characterized Mesozoic intracontinental deformation in the western NCP.
