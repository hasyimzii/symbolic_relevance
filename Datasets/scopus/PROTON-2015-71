A Facile and Efficient Synthesis of Six-Membered Enol Carbocyclic Compounds




 
© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart · New York-Synlett 2015. A facile and efficient method for the synthesis of six-membered enol carbocyclic compounds was realized by intermolecular cyclization reaction of 3-aryllidenepentane-2,4-diones with t-BuOK in CH2Cl2. The reaction is conducted under mild conditions and shows good functional group tolerance.
