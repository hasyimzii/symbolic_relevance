Nizwaside: A new anticancer pregnane glycoside from the sap of Desmidorchis flava
											




 
© 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Korea. The sap from the succulent Desmidorchis flava (N.E.Br) Meve and Liede yielded a new pregnane glycoside, named nizwaside whose structure was established using 1D and 2D NMR techniques as well as mass spectrometry (ESIMS). Nizwaside was tested for anticancer, DPPH antioxidant, urease enzyme inhibition, α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition and acetylcholinesterase inhibition activities. Interestingly, nizwaside showed significant anti-proliferative effects on MDA MB231 breast cancer cells with an IC50 of 23.5 μg/ml. Moreover, nizwaside was more effective than Doxorubicin, a well-known clinical anticancer drug, in suppressing MDA MB231 cell proliferation even at concentrations lower than that of Doxorubicin (75 μg/ml nizwaside vs. 100 μg/ml Doxorubicin). On the other hand, nizwaside showed relatively weak antioxidant activity with 15 % inhibition.
