In order to study the buckling law of steel plate reinforced concrete composite walls with super-large thickness for nuclear power engineering, based on three different steel plate elastic buckling theoretical models, 4 specimens of composite walls with steel plates and filled concrete under concentric loads are designed and tested. The stud distance-wall thickness ratio is designed as testing considered parameters. The failure mechanisms of the specimens, load-displacement relations and load-buckling are analyzed. Testing results indicate that the buckling of steel plate is of little influence on the stiffness of composite walls, the suitable layout of studs is effective guarantee of steel plate and concrete work together, and the ultimate bearing capacity of composite walls and buckling strain of the steel plate are increased with the decrease of stud distance-wall thickness ratio. The empirical formulae of ultimate bearing capacity and initial stiffness of composite wall are presented, and a theoretical formula is proposed for elastic buckling of steel plate of composite walls.
