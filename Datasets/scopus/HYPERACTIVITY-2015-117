Nonmedical use of prescription medication among adolescents using drugs in Quebec




 
Objective: To determine the prevalence and factors associated with nonmedical use of prescription medication (NMUPM) among adolescents who use drugs (ages 12 to 17 years) in Quebec. Method: Secondary data analyses were carried out with data from a 6-month study, namely, the 2010-2011 Quebec Health Survey of High School Students-a largescale survey that sought to gain a better understanding of the health and well-being of young Quebecers in high school. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to study NMUPM among adolescents who use drugs, according to sociodemographic characteristics, peer characteristics, health indicators (anxiety, depression, or attention-deficit disorder [ADD] with or without hyperactivity), self-competency, family environment, and substance use (alcohol and drug use) factors. Results: Among adolescents who had used drugs in the previous 12 months, 5.4% (95% CI 4.9% to 6.0%) reported NMUPM. Based on multivariate analyses, having an ADD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.47; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.91), anxiety disorder (AOR 2.14; 95% CI 1.57 to 2.92), low self-esteem (AOR 1.62; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.08), low self-control (AOR 1.95; 95% CI 1.55 to 2.45), low parental supervision (AOR 1.43; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.83), regular alcohol use (AOR 1.72; 95% CI 1.36 to 2.16), and polysubstance use (AOR 4.09; 95% CI 3.06 to 5.48) were associated with increased odds of reporting NMUPM. Conclusions: The observed prevalence of NMUPM was lower than expected. However, the associations noted with certain mental health disorders and regular or heavy use of other psychoactive substances are troubling. Clinical implications are discussed.
