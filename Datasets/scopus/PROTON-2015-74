Solvent-Free Green Synthesis of Azines and Their Conversion to 2,5-Disubstituted-1,3,4-thiadiazoles




 
Copyright Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. A solvent-free, clean, and efficient method has been developed for the synthesis of 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-thiadiazoles via azines. This approach exploits the synthetic potential of clean reactions and offers many advantages such as excellent product yields, easy isolation of products, and ecofriendly benign reaction conditions. The newly synthesized compounds were analyzed by infrared, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis.
