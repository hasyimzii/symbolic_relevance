Calculation of the shear capacity of fiber-reinforced concrete beam-column joint

The shear-resistance mechanism of fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) beam-column joints subjected to earthquake is simplified as a combination of the confined compression strut mechanism and the truss mechanism. The confined compression strut mechanism is undertaken by the confined FRC, which is composed of stirrups and FRC in the core of the joint. The truss mechanism is undertaken by the bond resistance between longitudinal reinforcements in the beam and column and the surrounding FRC in the core of the joint. Thus the calculation formula of the shear capacity of FRC beam-column joint considering the proportion of those two shear-resistance mechanism in the total shear-resistance mechanism was derived. The average ratio of experimental values of FRC beam-column joints (28 in total) to calculated values by the method is 1.04 with a coefficient of variation of 0.08. Thus the feasibility of the method is verified.
