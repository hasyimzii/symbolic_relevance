Studies on Antimicrobial Evaluation of Some 1-((1-(1 H-Benzo[ d[imidazol-2-yl)ethylidene)amino)-6-((arylidene)amino)-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1, 2-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarbonitriles




 
Â© 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. A new series of 1-((1-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)ethylidene)amino)-6-((arylidene)amino)-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarbonitriles (4a-o) have been synthesized for the development of antimicrobial agents. Newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus), and antifungal activity (Candida albicans, Aspergillus Niger, Aspergillus clavatus). These compounds were characterized by infrared, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectra. The synthesized compounds 4b, 4e, 4 h, and 4k showed potent antimicrobial activity against tested microorganisms.
