In order to reveal the mechanical properties of short age recycled coarse aggregate concrete under tri-axial compression, 14 cylinder specimens were designed for tri-axial compression test. Aging time and lateral confinement were considered as variables in the test. Failure patterns of specimens were observed, peak stress, peak strain, elastic modulus and stress-strain curves were obtained. Based on the experimental data, the influence of aging time and lateral confinement on the mechanical properties of short age recycled coarse aggregate concrete under tri-axial compression were analyzed; the strength calculation methods were discussed; the formulas of elastic modulus, peak strain, peak stress and stress-strain constitutive equation were put forward. Results show that: aging time has a great influence on peak strain and elastic modulus; on the other hand, peak stress, peak strain and elastic modulus of recycled coarse aggregate concrete are significantly influenced by lateral confinement. The calculated results by CEB-FIP(1990) are in good agreement with experimental data.
