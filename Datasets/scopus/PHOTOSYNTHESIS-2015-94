Expression profiling of potato cultivars with contrasting tuberization at elevated temperature using microarray analysis




 
© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. Temperature is one of the most significant factors affecting potato yield. Night temperature beyond 18-22 °C drastically reduces tuber formation, constraining potato cultivation in tropics and subtropics. Identification of genes and pathways affected by high temperature is crucial for developing thermo tolerant cultivars for these regions. In the present study, two cultivars with contrasting tuberization behavior at night temperatures (24 °C) were selected for gene expression analysis using a customized microarray chip representing 39,031 potato genes. A total of 2500 genes were differentially expressed on 21 d and 4096 genes on 14 d after stress. Gene ontology and pathway analysis provided insights into the probable biological processes and pathways governing tuberization at elevated temperature. Pathway maps were constructed to graphically represent the gene expression patterns. Genes associated with photosynthesis, hormonal activity, sugar transporters and transcription factors were differentially expressed. The results are presented and discussed in terms of tuberization at high temperature. The effect of high temperature on expression of genes controlling tuberization was also analyzed. This study provided useful information on potato tuberization at elevated temperature and make available a framework for further investigations into heat stress in potato.
