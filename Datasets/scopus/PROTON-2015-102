Structures and absolute stereochemistry of guaiane sesquiterpenoids from the gorgonian Menella woodin




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Guaiane sesquiterpenoids (1, 2) were isolated from the gorgonian Menella woodin and their structures elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis. A complex approach was used to determine the configurations of the asymmetric centres in these natural products, based on the application of Mosher's method, and the calculation of stable conformations of the rings along with a comparison of experimental ECD, NMR spectra, and specific optical rotations with those theoretically calculated by quantum-chemical methods.
