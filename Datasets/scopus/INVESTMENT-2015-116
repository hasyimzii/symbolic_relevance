Linking austrian and keynesian economics: A variation on a theme




 
Â© Fayetteville State University. All rights reserved. In the spirit of Roger Garrison's attempt to link Austrian economics with Keynesian economics, I created an Austrian-style four-stage model of the economy (gross output, or GO) that links the entire production process with the Keynesian model of final effective demand, or gross domestic product (GDP). As a supplement to GDP, GO can be integrated into textbook national income accounting. My paper concludes that GO is a more comprehensive measure of the economy and better reflects the role of business spending in the economy and the business cycle. It turns out that business spending is larger than GDP and almost twice the size of consumer spending. GO is also substantially more volatile than GDP throughout the business cycle. With the Bureau of Economic Analysis now publishing a quarterly GO statistic along with GDP, GO has become a major focus of economic research and reporting by the financial media.
