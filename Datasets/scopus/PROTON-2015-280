QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation on the mechanisms for the hydrolytic deamination of nicotinamidase




 
Â© 2015, Higher Education Press. All right reserved. The deamination process of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid by nicotinamidase simulated with combined QM(PM3)/MM molecular dynamics (MD) method. Our calculated results show that the whole mechanism includes four steps, transition of HS, nucleophilic attack by sulfur group, nucleophilic attack by hydroxyl group and proton transfer from Asp16 to Cys159.The rate-determined step is the nucleophilic attack by sulfur group. Through conformational analyses, we are able to indicate that high energy consumption mainly because the nucleophilic attack needs to break the hydrogen bond between substrate and Ala155.We suggest that mutation of the loop, which make Ala155 far from nicotinamide, could weaken the hydrogen bond and increase the reactivity of nicotinamidase. Based on this ground, release of ammonia and proton transfer processes are discussed in details. The results could give some useful suggestions to enzyme design and site-directed mutagenesis studies.
