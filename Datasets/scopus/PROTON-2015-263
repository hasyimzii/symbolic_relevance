Influence of anion induced proton abstraction on Cu(II) adsorption by alginic acid




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Alginic acid (AA) synthesized by acidification of commercial sodium alginate was investigated for its Cu(II) adsorption efficiency in the presence of different counter ions. The results of batch adsorption studies indicated an adsorption of 169.86 mg/g of Cu(II) by AA in the presence of acetate ions, however, it significantly decreased in the presence of chloride (126.36 mg/g), sulphate (115.24 mg/g) and nitrate (113.28 mg/g) as counter ions. This can be accounted to the tendency of conjugate base (anion) to abstract proton from AA, which determines the extent of deprotonation of carboxylic acid. The FTIR and TGA/DTA studies support the difference in the coordination of carboxylate to Cu(II) in the presence of various counter anions. Acetate showed strong chelate coordination between Cu(II) and AA, whereas in the presence of Cl-, NO3 - and SO4 2 -, Cu(II) was complexed by weak bridging coordination with AA.
