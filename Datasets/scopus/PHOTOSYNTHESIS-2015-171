Photocatalytic synthesis of anilides from nitrobenzenes under visible light irradiation: 2 in 1 reaction




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. An efficient method has been developed for the synthesis of a series of anilides via a two in one reaction of nitrobenzenes with anhydride in the presence of TiO2 as a nanocatalyst and photocatalyst under sunlight or blue LED irradiation. In this method simultaneously, nitrobenzenes convert to the corresponding anilines via photocatalytic reduction on the TiO2 surface, and a condensation of aniline with the anhydride performed on the Lewis acid site of the TiO2 surface. Interestingly amidation step leads to the promotion of better reaction and good selectivity in reduction of nitrocompounds. This method is simple, rapid, high yield, and green.
