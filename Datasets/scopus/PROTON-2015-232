Gold catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation assisted ring opening of furans to the corresponding saturated γ-keto esters




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. A facile ring opening of furans in furyl propargyl alcohols to the corresponding saturated γ-keto esters is observed in the gold(III) chloride catalyzed reaction with MeOH. It is found that the ring opening of furan is driven by the intramolecular hydroalkoxylation. Mitigating the intramolecular hydroalkoxylation led to the expected conjugated enyne resulting from the dehydration.
