This paper summarized the applicable scope and formulas of Chinese specification model, MC2010 model, ACI209 model, and B3 model, and compared the predication accuracy for creep and shrinkage of high strength lightweight aggregate concrete. The prediction models got good results for basic creep, but not good for shrinkage. After analysis of parameters, experimental data in literature were employed to build a modified MC2010 model which considered the influences of water content in aggregate. Comparisons between the predicted results and published data indicate that the modified model has better precision for shrinkage of high strength lightweight aggregate concrete.
