Decreased amyloid-β and increased neuronal hyperactivity by immunotherapy in Alzheimer's models




 
© 2015 Nature America, Inc. Among the most promising approaches for treating Alzheimeŕs disease is immunotherapy with amyloid-β (Aβ)-targeting antibodies. Using in vivo two-photon imaging in mouse models, we found that two different antibodies to Aβ used for treatment were ineffective at repairing neuronal dysfunction and caused an increase in cortical hyperactivity. This unexpected finding provides a possible cellular explanation for the lack of cognitive improvement by immunotherapy in human studies.
