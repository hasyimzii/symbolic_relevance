Effect of the Hydrogen Bond on Photochemical Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles




 
Â© 2015 American Chemical Society. The effect of a hydrogen bond on the photochemical synthesis of silver nanoparticles has been investigated via experimental and theoretical methods. In a benzophenone system, the photochemical synthesis process includes two steps, which are that hydrogen abstraction reaction and the following reduction reaction. We found that for the first step, an intermolecular hydrogen bond enhances the proton transfer. The efficiency of hydrogen abstraction increases with the hydrogen bond strength. For the second step, the hydrogen-bonded ketyl radical complex shows higher reducibility than the ketyl radical. The inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurement exhibits a 2.49 times higher yield of silver nanoparticles in the hydrogen bond ketyl radical complex system than that for the ketyl radical system. Theoretical calculations show that the hydrogen bond accelerates electron transfer from the ketyl radical to the silver ion by raising the SOMO energy of the ketyl radical; thus, the SOMO-LUMO interaction is more favorable.
