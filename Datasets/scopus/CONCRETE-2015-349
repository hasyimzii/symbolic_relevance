Ways of strengthening filler coupling with cement concrete matrix
												 




 
Â© Research India Publications. Strengthening of filler coupling with a cement concrete matrix can be provided due to physical and chemical accretion of the filler surface layers with a cement concrete matrix. Use of the fissile fillers which interact with cement matrix on various mechanisms reducing contact layer penetration is expedient for this purpose, promotes increase in force of cement stone separation from filler and increase of products longevity. Classification of the fissile fillers by character of interaction forces between them and cement concrete matrix is offered. Consistent patterns of the hydrated phases structure formation which are besieged in cement matrix filler contact zone depending on the filler electro-surface characteristics are determined. It allows to make a reasonable fillers choice depending on the binding structure and severe atmospheres contacting with these products and designs. On the basis of the executed thermodynamic calculations ranging of the surface layers affinity of sour silicate Ca(OH)2 fillers, contained in concrete steam liquid is made.
