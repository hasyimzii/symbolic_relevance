Poly-iodinated closo 1,2-C2B10 and nido [7,8-C2B9]- carborane frameworks: Synthesis and consequences




 
© 2015 Elsevier B.V. The preparation of Cc-monosubstituted closo and nido carborane derivatives, mono-, di and tetraiodinated is reported. Some of these mono-to poly-iodinated nido carboranes are studied in terms of the acidity of the open face bridging proton, their chemical shift position in the 1H NMR, and the lesser tendency to η5-coordination in parallel to a larger number of iodo groups.
