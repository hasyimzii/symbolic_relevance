The measure of the bond is the value of pull-off adhesion fb experimentally determined in building practice by the semi-destructive (SDT) pull-off method. In this paper it is proposed to assess pull-off adhesion by jointly the optical laser triangulation method and the acoustic impulse response method, using artificial neural networks (ANN), on the basis of a few parameters (independent of top layer thickness) determined by these methods. The proposed non-destructive (NDT) pull-off adhesion assessment method is devoid of the drawbacks and inconveniences of the pull-off method and makes possible the reliable mapping of the adhesion level on the tested surface without local damage to the latter.
