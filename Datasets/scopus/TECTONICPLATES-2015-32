The Lower Yangtze region is an important area including hydrocarbon basins in eastern China, where Cenozoic tectonic deformation is the core of Cenozoic tectonic dynamics. In order to better understand the mechanism of extensional tectonics and the implications, the structure and framework of the Cenozoic fault basin in the Lower Yangtze region are studied. The regional basin structure reveals that the extensional structure is composed of a series of normal faults with totally arc-like changing strikes from NNE, to NE, and to NEE, displaying multidirectional extension and fault depression structure controlled by extensional fault system in the Lower Yangtze region, which can be divided into three extensional regions from south to north: Jiangnan extensional region, Yanjiang-Subei-South Yellow Sea extensional region, and northern South Yellow Sea extensional region. The numerical and structural physical simulations reveal that, subjected to the lateral tectonic stress triggered by the subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the Eurasian plate, the Lower Yangtze block moves laterally and extends regionally, and the Tan-Lu fault slips dextrally, which have formed a tectonic deformation system with dextral strike slip of Tan-Lu fault and lateral extension of Lower Yangtze block. Tectonically, Cenozoic extensional tectonics and formation mechanism of basins in the east of the Daxing'anling-Taihangshan-Wulingshan gravity lineament have been closely related to boundary condition of the Paleo-Pacific plate.
