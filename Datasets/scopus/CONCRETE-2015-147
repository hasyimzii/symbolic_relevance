Using high-resolution industrial CT scan to detect the distribution of rejuvenation products in porous asphalt concrete




 
Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. The possibilities of applying preventive maintenance to porous asphalt (PA) wearing courses by means of spraying rejuvenation products on the pavement surfaces are being investigated with unprecedented interest in the Netherlands. Three rejuvenation products were applied on two field trials of 5 year old PA pavement surfaces. High-resolution industrial Computed Tomography (CT) scans were performed on the PA concrete cores that were obtained from the field trial sections to detect the distribution of the rejuvenation products. Two rejuvenation products were detected by the high-resolution industrial CT scans and the microstructure of the PA concrete cores were analyzed.
