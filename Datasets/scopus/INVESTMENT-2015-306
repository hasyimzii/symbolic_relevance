The aim of the article was the analysis of the relations of the coexistence of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and selected management methods: Benchmarking, Business Process Management (BPM), Business Process Reengineering (BPR), Balanced Scorecard (BSC), Competency-based Management (CBM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Knowledge Management (KM), Lean Management (LM), Outsourcing, Six Sigma, Total Quality Management (TQM). Contemporary organisations invest more and more in enterprise systems, including ERP systems, and high growth of these investments is still predicted. The complexity and dynamics of modern management systems in fact determine the simultaneous and sequential application of many management concepts and methods. In the main, however, the coexistence of implemented solutions should be beneficial for an organisation. The theoretical views on the relations of ERP and selected management methods have thus been empirically verified in the analysis of differences in the assessment of a number of effects of using the selected management methods in pairs with ERP as well as separately (business, efficiency, management, social and environmental effects) were investigated. One-way ANOVA was used for a sample of 167 Polish organizations.
