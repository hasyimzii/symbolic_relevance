Synthesis of natural phaeosphaeride A derivatives and an in vitro evaluation of their anti-cancer potential




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Derivatives of phaeosphaeride A (PPA) were synthesised and characterised; then anti-cancer studies were carried out on the A549 cancer cell line. It was found that the acetyl derivative (compound 3) displayed comparable in vitro cytotoxicity to that of PPA (EC50 = 49 ± 7 μM and EC50 = 46 ± 5 μM, respectively), while chloroacetyl derivative 6 (EC50 = 33 ± 7 μM) was found to have better efficacy towards the A549 cancer cell line.
