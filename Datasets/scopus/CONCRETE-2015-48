Effect of curing compounds on the properties and microstructure of cement concretes




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. With the aim of specifying the type of curing compound for water-scarce areas, four types of curing compound (acrylic-based, paraffin-based, silicate-based and composite-based) were chosen to investigate the effect of curing compound on the mechanical property, durability and microstructure of cement concretes. The effect was assessed by measuring compressive and flexural strength, drying shrinkage, impermeability and crack resistance. The results indicated that curing compounds were effective in increasing the compressive, flexural strength and the impermeability of concretes, and decreasing the drying shrinkage and cracks. In general, the composite-based and the acrylic-based curing compound performed better than the paraffin-based and the silicate-based curing compound. At the same time, microstructure test results showed that curing compound promoted the hydration of the cement to form a compact and homogenous microstructure, and AFt crystalline particles were rod-like with a larger size.
