Early-age index choosing for long-term quality evaluation of concrete structures




 
This paper aims to reveal the relationship between typical early-age and long-term properties of concrete structures, in order to select proper early-age indexes to predict or evaluate the long-term performance of concrete structures. Four groups of concrete specimens were prepared in different construction scenarios. Cube compressive strength, air permeability, chloride ion penetration, steel bar corrosion, and porosity of the four groups of concrete specimens were tested at different ages. The test results have confirmed the significant influence of both vibration and curing conditions on concrete qualities. Furthermore, in this study, the 28-day air permeability index has been proved to have good correlation with the tested durability indexes, including the chloride ion diffusion coefficient and corrosion current density of steel bars in concrete. It is recommended in this paper that the 28-day air permeability index, together with the 28-day compressive strength, should be chosen as the early-age property index for long-term quality evaluation or prediction of concrete structures.
