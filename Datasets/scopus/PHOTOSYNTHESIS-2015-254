The effect of methanol on photosynthetic parameters of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) under water deficit




 
Â© 2015 The Institute of Experimental Botany Water availability is the main factor limiting crop growth and productivity in dry regions. This study was carried out on bean plants to determine the effect of spraying methanol solution on the photosynthetic characteristics. The main aim of our experiments was to improve plant performance under stress caused by water shortage. Two factors were involved: water deficit stress, such as severe stress (25% of field capacity), mild stress (75% of field capacity), and no stress (100% of field capacity) and application of methanol solution spray at four concentrations: control (without spraying), 10, 20, and 30%. Methanol was applied three times at different growth stages (seedling, flowering, and podding stage) in 10-d intervals. The treatment with 20% methanol at the seedling stage resulted in increased net photosynthesis (PN), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and decreased transpiration rate (E) under nonstress and mild stress conditions. Under severe stress, 10 and 20%-methanol treatments resulted in increased Ci, maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry, and decreased E. At the flowering stage, methanol treatments resulted in decreased E and increased Ci under mild and severe stress. At the podding stage, 10 and 20%-methanol treatments resulted in increased PN, Ci, and total chlorophyll content under mild stress. In conclusion, we suggested that foliar application of methanol had a positive role in enhancing photosynthetic performance.
