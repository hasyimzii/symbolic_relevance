A review of intrinsic self-healing capability of engineered cementitious composites: Recovery of transport and mechanical properties

The need for viable materials in sustainable infrastructures is driving the creation of multifunctional strain-hardening cementitious composites that combine brittle cementitious matrices with fibers. Unlike conventional concrete, these materials typically show multiple microcracking behavior with strain-hardening response under tensile loading. Even with tight widths, however, crack formation is a critical problem that reduces the mechanical performance of structures and accelerates the ingress of water and aggressive substances. As part of a class of cement-based composites exhibiting strain-hardening response, engineered cementitious composites (ECCs) have a high likelihood of preventing water and harmful chemicals from penetrating by sealing existing cracks and regaining original mechanical and durability properties through self-healing. This promises to contribute to the development of a new generation of highly durable, damage-tolerant structures. ECCs are potentially excellent for intrinsic self-healing due to tight crack widths and high amounts of supplementary cementitious materials in their mixture proportions. This paper details the parameters governing self-healing efficiency and the effect of self-healing on the residual mechanical and transport properties of cementitious composites. Test methods measuring the effect of these parameters on healing efficiency are also described.
