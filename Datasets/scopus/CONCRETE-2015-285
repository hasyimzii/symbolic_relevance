Recent durability studies on concrete structure




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. The durability of concrete has attracted significant attention over the past several decades and is still a research hotspot until now. This paper reviews and discusses recent research activities on the durability of concrete, including: 1) major durability problems such as alkali aggregate reaction, sulfate attack, steel corrosion and freeze-thaw; 2) durability of concrete in marine environment; and 3) coupling effects of mechanical load and environmental factors on durability of concrete. Moreover, the consideration of durability in concrete structure design (DuraCrete and performance-based specifications) is also briefly reviewed.
