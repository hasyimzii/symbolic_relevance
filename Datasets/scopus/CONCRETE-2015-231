The mechanism and size characteristics of micro crack on polished surface of Ti6Al4V are discussed by numerical simulation and experimental investigation. The latent heat of material phase change and material parameters varying with temperature are considered in this model. The change rules of temperature and stress fields in time domain and space domain are acquired and the finite element model is verified by experiments. The micro cracks generation mechanism and size characteristics of pulse polished Ti6Al4V are revealed via analysis of temperature field, stress field and solidification processes of the Ti6Al4V. The micro cracks of laser polishing are formed at solidification initiation moment, and the width of micro cracks is determined by plastic deformation and the micro crack depth depends on depth of molten pool. The laser power exerts the most significant influence on the size characteristics of micro cracks. The width and depth of the micro cracks all obviously increase with the increasing laser power. The cooling rate of the molten metal can be slowed down by preheating in the pulse laser polishing process to effectively decrease the size of micro cracks.
