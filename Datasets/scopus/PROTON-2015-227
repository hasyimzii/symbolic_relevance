Copper(II) Bromide-Catalyzed C-C/C-N Bond-Forming Reactions: Synthesis of Pyrrole-Incorporated Triarylmethanes




 
Â© 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. We have achieved a facile copper(II) bromide-catalyzed synthesis of 2,3,4-trisubtitued pyrrole incorporated into unsymmetrical triarylmethanes through direct replacement of hydroxyl group in the pyrrolyl phenyl methanol with electron-rich aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds. The newly developed method has been applied to a facile synthesis of a C2 symmetric bis-triarylmethane in which the two triarylmethanes were bridged through piperzine. The copper(II) bromide catalysis led to C-C bond formation at the C(5) position when the reacting partner was imidazole. In contrast, C-N bond formation took place with benzimdazole or 2-methylbenzimidazole.
