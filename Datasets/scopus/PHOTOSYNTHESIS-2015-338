Removal of Cr(VI) and phenol using water hyacinth from single and binary solution in the artificial photosynthesis chamber




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. In this study, water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) was used for the uptake of two important pollutants Cr(VI) and phenol from single and binary solution. Artificial photosynthesis was carried out at 30 °C and 60% relative humidity. Experiments were carried out at four concentrations 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/L of Cr(VI) and 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg/L of phenol in both single and binary mixtures of Cr(VI) and phenol, respectively. In a single component solution of Cr(VI) 99.00% removal was achieved at 5 mg/L in 16 days of operation while in case of single component solution of phenol 99.80% removal was achieved at 10 mg/L in 14 days. In a binary solution of Cr(VI) and phenol 99.00% removal of Cr(VI) was achieved at 5 mg/L of Cr(VI) and 10 mg/L of phenol in 7 days and 11 days of operation, respectively. It was observed that 99.00% removal of Cr(VI) was achieved in less time and also at higher concentration of Cr(VI) in the presence of phenol. The FTIR and EDX analysis was carried out to confirm the uptake of Cr(VI) and phenol. The uptake of Cr(VI) was found more in the presence of phenol which shows the synergistic effect for the removal of Cr(VI). It could be due to the fact that phenol was used as carbon or carbohydrate energy source by the plant at more stressed condition. In case of both single and binary solution, toxic effect was observed at 20 mg/L of Cr(VI).
