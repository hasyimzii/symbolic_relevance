Herein, we report the preparation of zeolite NIR luminescence materials with a remarkable increase of luminescence intensity by attaching stopper molecule (an imidazolium salt) to the channel entrances of zeolite L loading with NIR lanthanide (Er3+ or Nd3+) β-diketonate complexes. This results from the formation of Ln3+-β-diketonate complexes (Ln=Er or Nd) with high coordination numbers through the decreasing of the proton strength in the zeolite channels. The obtained materials were characterized with SEM and photoluminescence spectroscopy. We believe that this hybrid material will be an appealing candidate for the applications of optical fiber, telecommunications and bio-imaging. In the study, we present the preparation of zeolite NIR luminescence materials with a remarkable increase of luminescence intensity by attaching stopper molecule (an imidazolium salt) to the channel entrances of zeolite L loading with NIR lanthanide (Er3+) or Nd3+)) β-diketonate complexes.
