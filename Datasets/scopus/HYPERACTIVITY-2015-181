Neuroimaging with magnetoencephalography: A dynamic view of brain pathophysiology




 
© 2016 Elsevier Inc. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a noninvasive, silent, and totally passive neurophysiological imaging method with excellent temporal resolution (∼1 ms) and good spatial precision (∼3-5 mm). In a typical experiment, MEG data are acquired as healthy controls or patients with neurologic or psychiatric disorders perform a specific cognitive task, or receive sensory stimulation. The resulting data are generally analyzed using standard electrophysiological methods, coupled with advanced image reconstruction algorithms. To date, the total number of MEG instruments and associated users is significantly smaller than comparable human neuroimaging techniques, although this is likely to change in the near future with advances in the technology. Despite this small base, MEG research has made a significant impact on several areas of translational neuroscience, largely through its unique capacity to quantify the oscillatory dynamics of activated brain circuits in humans. This review focuses on the clinical areas where MEG imaging has arguably had the greatest impact in regard to the identification of aberrant neural dynamics at the regional and network level, monitoring of disease progression, determining how efficacious pharmacologic and behavioral interventions modulate neural systems, and the development of neural markers of disease. Specifically, this review covers recent advances in understanding the abnormal neural oscillatory dynamics that underlie Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders, cerebral palsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, cognitive aging, and post-traumatic stress disorder. MEG imaging has had a major impact on how clinical neuroscientists understand the brain basis of these disorders, and its translational influence is rapidly expanding with new discoveries and applications emerging continuously.
