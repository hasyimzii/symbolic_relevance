Acoustic performance of timber and timber-concrete floors




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. This paper deals with the acoustic performance of timber and timber-concrete floor solutions assessed through an experimental campaign. In the case of the composite solutions, two types of concrete were adopted: a normal and a lightweight composition, the last one incorporating expanded cork aggregates. The acoustic tests were performed under controlled conditions in laboratory, to determine the airborne and impact sound insulations. The basic solutions were also evaluated including the presence of a ceiling composed of gypsum plasterboard and mineral wool. The results reveal a promising behavior of the tested solutions, particularly the composite solutions.
