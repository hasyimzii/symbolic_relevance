Large area concrete surface topography measurements using optical 3D scanner




 
Â© 2015 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. The paper presents examinations of the surface of base concrete with a 3D scanner. Two base concrete surfaces, differently prepared, were examined, together with two measurement strategies: simple and fast 3D scanning and partial scanning in selected areas corresponding to the device measurement space. In order to complete the analysis of a concrete surface topography an original Matlab-based program TAS (Topography Analysis and Simulation) was developed for both 2D and 3D surface analyses. It enables data processing, calculation of parameters, data visualization and digital filtration.
