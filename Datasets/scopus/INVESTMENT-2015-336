The role of Japanese FDI in China




 
Â© 2016 Society for Policy Modeling. We quantify the impacts of a sharp fall of Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI) to China that occurred after the worldwide financial crisis in 2009 using a three-region (Japan, China, and the rest of the world) recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model with multinational enterprises (MNEs). The FDI fall would reduce exports and production of Japanese MNE affiliates in China and depreciate the Renminbi. This latter effect would favor Chinese manufacturing, but China, would not be a gainer, because it would experience a contraction in its service sector, which would exceed the gains in manufacturing.
