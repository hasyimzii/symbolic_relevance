Principles of integrated analysis of modern stresses and strains in the outer crust of the Amurian plate




 
© 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. The principles and findings of the research into modern stress–strain state of the outer crust within the Amurian lithospheric plate are described. The integrated geomechanical assessment of ground conditions uses the method of the remote sensing. The authors demonstrate information content of the offered approach to different scale data analysis aimed at either assessment of regional stress state, or at refinement of non-tectonic features in the zones of localization of rockburst-hazardous mineral deposits.
