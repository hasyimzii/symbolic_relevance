Photosynthesis, antioxidant status and gas-exchange are altered by glyphosate application in peanut leaves




 
Â© 2015 The Institute of Experimental Botany Glyphosate herbicide caused oxidative stress and exhibited negative effects on photosynthesis and gas exchange of peanut [Arachis hypogaea L. cv. Giza (G) 5 and 6] leaves. We demonstrated that glyphosate caused various morphological symptoms, such as chlorosis, yellowing, and appearance of curly edges in leaves treated with high doses of herbicide in both cultivars; however, G5 cultivar was more sensitive and showed severer symptoms. Glyphosate lowered photosynthesis and reduced contents of pigments and proteins as well as free amino acids in both cultivars. The gasexchange parameters, such as photosynthetic (PN) and transpiration rate (E), were highly altered by the glyphosate application. For example, PN and E were reduced by 65 and 61 %, respectively, compared with control in G5 treated with high dose of glyphosate. Antioxidant enzymes, such as peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase were induced both low and high concentrations in glyphosate-treated leaves. Moreover, the level of lipid peroxidation, indicated by a malondialdehyde content, as well as the hydrogen peroxide content increased in the glyphosate treated leaves. However, an increase in total antioxidant activity (TAA) in leaves was detected and this reflected changes in the antioxidant status and accumulation of antioxidants as a defense mechanism against glyphosate toxicity in peanut.
