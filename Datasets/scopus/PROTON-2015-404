A First Synthesis of Bis(benzoxazole) Natural Products: Nataxazole and AJI9561 via Benzoxazole C-H Activation




 
Â© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart . New York. Concise and efficient syntheses of nataxazole and AJI9561 have been accomplished. We also demonstrate a convenient route to obtain the related natural product UK-1. The key step involves C-H activation of a benzoxazole in the presence of ortho-iodoanilides using a copper(I) iodide/Xantphos/palladium(II) acetate system.
