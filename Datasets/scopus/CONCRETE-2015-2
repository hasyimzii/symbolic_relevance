Application of a combination of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash and lightweight aggregate in concrete




 
© 2015 Taylor & Francis This paper highlights significant findings from focusing on developing a sustainable lightweight aggregate (LWA) concrete, which replaced Portland cement partially with municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI FA) and all of the conventional coarse aggregate with LWA sintered by MSWI FA, shale, and sludge. A series of four experiments, differing in dosage of MSWI FA and aggregate, were conducted for this project. The results of this study generally showed that appropriate amount of MSWI FA substitution for cement has no significantly lowered the compressive strengths of LWA concrete, while it can lower the oven-dry density and the thermal conductivity. The optimum performance of LWA concrete (after 28 days of curing) is as follows: (1) slump flow of 700 mm, (2) compressive strength of 30.14 MPa, (3) dry apparent density of 1.66 g/cm3, (4) thermal conductivity of 0.73 W (m K)−1; the mixture ratio of LWA, fly ash, cement, and fine sand is 3.0: 0.1: 0.9: 2.0 based on dry weight. Meanwhile, the results of leaching test are much lower than the concentration limits of hazardous constituents of hazardous waste identification standard (GB/T 5083.3-2007) and landfill standard (GB16889-2008).
