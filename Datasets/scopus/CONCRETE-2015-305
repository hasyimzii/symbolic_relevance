Experimental study on mixture ratio design of high-performance concrete used on high-speed ballastless railway




 
Â© 2015 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. High-performance concrete is designed with high strength, high durability and high workability and is used for a particular purpose and environment. Considering the working characteristics and durability requirements of high-speed ballastless railway, experimental study on mix proportion design and maintenance measures of C60 high-strength concrete are conducted. It is proposed from the orthogonal test that the optimal mixture ratio scheme for high-performance concrete used on high-speed ballastless railway is that water-cement ratio is 0.29, sand ratio is 38% and admixture ratio of the total cementitious material is 10%. The influence regularity is obtained on compressive strength at different periods of high-performance concrete by main influencing factors such as water-cement ratio, admixture amount, sand rate, etc. Tests show that water-cement ratio affects the later strength while admixture amount affects the early strength and sand rate has little effect.
