Concrete cover cracking induced by corrosion of steel reinforcement is a major influencing factor for durability and service-ability of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Here in the study, the influence of concrete meso-structure on the failure pattern of concrete cover is accounted for. At the meso-scale, the concrete is assumed to be a three-phase composite composed of aggregate, mortar matrix and the interfacial transition zone (ITZ). A random aggregate structure of concrete is established for the study on the mechanical behavior of cover subjected to corrosion expansion of steel reinforcement. In the simulations, the plasticity damaged model is used to describe the mechanical behavior of the mortar matrix and the ITZ, and it is assumed that the corrosion of steel reinforcement is uniform. Based on the above assumptions, the cracking of concrete cover due to steel reinforcement corrosion is numerically simulated. The failure patterns obtained from the macro-scale homogeneous model and the present meso-scale heterogeneous model are compared. The effects of the ratio of cover thickness and reinforcement diameter (i. e. c/d), the position of the steel reinforcement (i.e., the middle and corner zones) and the concrete tensile strength on the steel corrosion level when the concrete cover cracks are investigated. Finally, some useful conclusions are drawn.
