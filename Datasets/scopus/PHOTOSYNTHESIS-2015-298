Identification of novel cupredoxin homologs using overlapped conserved residues based approach




 
© 2015 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology. Cupredoxin-like proteins are mainly copper-binding proteins that conserve a typical rigid Greek-key arrangement consisting of an eight-stranded β-sandwich, even though they share as little as 10-15% sequence similarity. The electron transport function of the Cupredoxins is critical for respiration and photosynthesis, and the proteins have therapeutic potential. Despite their crucial biological functions, the identification of the distant Cupredoxin homologs has been a difficult task due to their low sequence identity. In this study, the overlapped conserved residue (OCR) fingerprint for the Cupredoxin superfamily, which consists of conserved residues in three aspects (i.e., the sequence, structure, and intramolecular interaction), was used to detect the novel Cupredoxin homologs in the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database. The OCR fingerprint could identify 54 potential Cupredoxin sequences, which were validated by scanning them against the conserved Cupredoxin motif near the Cu-binding site. This study also attempted to model the 3D structures and to predict the functions of the identified potential Cupredoxins. This study suggests that the OCR-based approach can be used efficiently to detect novel homologous proteins with low sequence identity, such as Cupredoxins.
