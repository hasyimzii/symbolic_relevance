Recognition of Car Makes and Models From a Single Traffic-Camera Image




 
Â© 2000-2011 IEEE. This paper proposes the recognition framework of car makes and models from a single image captured by a traffic camera. Due to various configurations of traffic cameras, a traffic image may be captured in different viewpoints and lighting conditions, and the image quality varies in resolution and color depth. In the framework, cars are first detected using a part-based detector, and license plates and headlamps are detected as cardinal anchor points to rectify projective distortion. Car features are extracted, normalized, and classified using an ensemble of neural-network classifiers. In the experiment, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a data set of practical traffic images. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in vehicle detection and model recognition.
