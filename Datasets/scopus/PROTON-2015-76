One-Pot, Facile, Highly Efficient, and Green Synthesis of Acridinedione Derivatives Using Vitamin B 1




 
Copyright Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. An efficient methodology for the synthesis of acridinedione derivatives 4a-o has been achieved by one-pot, multicomponent condensation of dimedone 1, various amines 2a-d, and substitute aromatic aldehydes 3a-k, in the presence of the easily available, inexpensive, and nontoxic catalyst vitamin B1(VB1) as a versatile biodegradable. Synthesis of acridine-type compounds was performed in good yields in water as green solvent. Its high-yield efficiency; clean, ecofriendly, simple workup procedure; and easy purification are regarded as the main advantages of this method besides its green solvent. The synthesized compounds are characterized using spectroscopic analyses (FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry) techniques.
