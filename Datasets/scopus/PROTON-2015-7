Chiral primary amino alcohol organobase catalysts for the asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions of anthrones with maleimides




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Simple chiral triethylsilyl-amino alcohol organocatalysts containing a bulky triethylsilyl group on the oxygen atom at the γ-position were designed and synthesized as new organocatalysts for enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions of anthrones with maleimides to produce chiral hydroanthracene Diels-Alder adducts in up to 99% yield and with up to 94% ee.
