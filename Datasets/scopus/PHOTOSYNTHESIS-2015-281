Kinetic characterization of the photosynthetic reaction centres in microalgae by means of fluorescence methodology




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. The kinetic characterization of the photosynthetic activity in autotrophic microalgae plays a key role in the design of optimized photobioreactors. This paper presents a procedure to assess kinetic parameters of a three-state photosynthetic reaction centres model. Four kinetic parameters of the model were assessed by processing the time-series measurements of pulse-amplitude modulation fluorimetry. The kinetic parameters were assessed for several microalgal strains (Stichococcus bacillaris, Scenedesmus vacuolatus, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris) growth in vertical and inclined bubble columns and irradiated by white-light or red/blue light.The procedure was successfully applied to the investigated strains. The assessed parameters allow identifying the irradiance range under which: the photochemical process is controlled by the photons capture; the photoinhibition competes with the photochemical quenching. The analysis of the time-scale of the photosynthetic reaction centres as a function of the irradiance allows interpreting the performances of photobioreactors characterized by non-homogeneous irradiance.
