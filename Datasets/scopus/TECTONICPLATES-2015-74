3D Moho depth beneath the middle-lower Yangtze metallogenic belt and its surrounding areas: Insight from the wide angle seismic data




 
Â© 2015, Science Press. All right reserved. To understand the formation and the tectonic processes of the Mesozoic Middle Lower Yangtze metallogenic belt (MLYMB), the SinoProbe-03-02 program conducted a 450 km long in-line controlled-source seismic experiment with a 400 km long off-line data collection across the Ning-wu ore-district. We deal with the off-line seismic data using normal moveout correction and time-depth conversion in order to obtain the off-line Moho depth. Using the Moho depth derived both from in-line and off-line seismic data, we construct a Moho depth map in the Middle-Lower Yangtze metallogenic belt and its surrounding areas. The results show that the Moho depth is about 32~34 km beneath the Ning-Wu ore-district, shallower than that beneath the Hefei basin in North China which is about 34~35 km. The variation tendency of Moho depth coincides with the Bouguer gravity anomaly well. The uplifting characteristic of Moho depth in Ning-Wu ore-district supports the model of lithosphere delamination, asthenosphere welling, and mantle-derived magmatic underplating during the formation of MLYMB. The variation of Moho beneath metallogenic belt parallels the strike of the MLYMB. It supports the tangential flow deformation in NE-SW direction in the plate boundary of the crust and mantle. On both sides of Tanlu fault zone, the depth of the Moho changes greatly, which indicates that the Tanlu fault may extend to the mantle.
