There is a recognized need to assess the efficacyof psychotherapy in adult ADHD.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of cognitive behavioral group psychotherapy (GPT)compared with individual clinical management (CM) and that of methylphenidatehydrochloride compared with placebo.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of 18-to 58-year-old outpatients with ADHD from 7 German study centers. Patients were recruitedbetween January 2007 and August 2010, treatment was finalized in August 2011, and finalfollow-up assessments occurred in March 2013.INTERVENTIONS Sessions of GPT and CM were held weekly for the first 12 weeks and monthlythereafter (9 months). Patients received either methylphenidate or placebo for 1 year.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas the change in the ADHD Index ofthe Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale from baseline to the end of the 3-month intensivetreatment (blinded observer ratings). Secondary outcomes included ADHD ratings after 1year, blinded observer ratings using the Clinical Global Impression Scale, and self-ratings ofdepression.RESULTS Among 1480 prescreened patients, 518were assessed for eligibility, 433were centrallyrandomized, and 419were analyzed as randomized. After 3 months, the ADHD Index all-groupbaseline mean of 20.6 improved to adjusted means of 17.6 for GPT and 16.5 for CM, with nosignificant difference between groups. Methylphenidate (adjusted mean, 16.2)was superior toplacebo (adjusted mean, 17.9) (difference, -1.7; 97.5%CI, -3.0 to -0.4; P = .003). After 1 year, treatment effects remained essentially stable. Descriptive analyses showed thatmethylphenidatewas superior to placebo in patients assigned to GPT (difference, -1.7; 95%CI, -3.2 to -0.1; P = .04) orCM (difference, -1.7; 95%CI, -3.3 to -0.2; P = .03). Regardingdepression, no significant differenceswere found. In contrast, GPTwas superior toCMfor allvisits in the Clinical Global Impression global assessment of effectiveness.CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Highly structured group intervention did not outperformindividual CM with regard to the primary outcome. Psychological interventions resulted inbetter outcomes during a 1-year period when combined with methylphenidate as comparedwith placebo.
