The Tiansheng Port special ship channel bridge of the Hutong Changjiang River Bridge is a flexible arch bridge with three-span continuous rigid girder with span arrangement (140+336+140) m. The main pier No. 4 of the bridge is located in the riverbed area of deep silty sand stratum in the Changjiang River and the foundation for the pier has 36 nos. of φ2.5 m bored piles that are 115 m long and are bored to the depth of 121.5 m. In the light of the characteristics that the stratum succession at the foundation is complex, the phase changes are drastic and the silty sand stratum is deep, the construction of the bored piles of the pier was carried out, using the boring platform. The holes of the piles were bored, using the high-power air lifting reverse circulating boring machine and the high-quality PHP slurry. The reinforcement cages for the piles were manufactured by the long line match method and were lowered in sections into the holes after the holes were well bored and cleared off for the first time by the air lifting reverse circulating. At this stage, the holes were cleared off again for the second time, the holes were inspected and the tremie concrete for the piles was cast by the tremie duct method. The ultrasonic inspection and the hole depth measurement data of the bored piles of the pier after the construction showed that the diameters and inclination degrees of the bored holes and the sediment thickness of the second time clearing all met the special quality inspection and evaluation criteria of the project and the pile shafts also met the standard of Class I piles.
