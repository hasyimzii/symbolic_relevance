Global Mean Square Exponential Stability of Impulsive Non-autonomous Stochastic Neural Networks with Mixed Delays




 
Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York In this work, we consider a class of impulsive non-autonomous stochastic neural networks with mixed delays. By establishing a new generalized Halanay inequality with impulses, we obtain some sufficient conditions ensuring global mean square exponential stability of the addressed neural networks. The sufficient conditions are easily checked in practice by simple algebra methods and have a wider adaptive range. An example is given to illustrate our results.
