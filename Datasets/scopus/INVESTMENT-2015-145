Â© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York. In recent years, progress in information and communication technology (ICT) has caused many structural changes such as the reorganization of economics, globalization, and trade extension, which leads to capital flows and enhancing information availability. Moreover, ICT plays a significant role in development of each economic sector, especially during liberalization process. Economists predict that economic growth is driven by investments in ICT. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of ICT on economic growth in Tunisia. The results indicate that there is a positive relationship between the growth rate of GDP and the index of ICT use (as measured by the number of user mobile and fixed phone lines in Tunisia).
