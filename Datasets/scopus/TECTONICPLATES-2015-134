Structural analysis of the Hasan-Robat marbles as traces of folded basement in the Sanandaj–Sirjan Zone, Iran
	




 
© 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc. Cherty marbles of Hasan-Robat area, northwest of Isfahan, in the Sanandaj–Sirjan Zone of Iran preserves evidences of multiple deformational events. The Sanandaj–Sirjan Zone is the inner crystalline zone of the Zagros Orogen, which has been highly deformed and exhumed during continental collision between the Arabian Plate and Central Iran. The Hasan-Robat area is an example of the exposed Precambrian–Paleozoic basement rocks that stretched along two NW–SE-trending faults and located in the inner part of the HasanRobat positive flower strcuture. The Hasan-Robat marbles record a complex shortening and shearing history. This lead to the development of disharmonic ptygmatic folds with vertical to sub-vertical axes and some interference patterns of folding that may have been created from deformations during the Pan-African Orogeny and later phases. Based on this research, tectonic evolution of the Hasan-Robat area is interpreted as the product of three major geotectonic events that have been started after Precambrian to Quaternary: (1) old deformation phases (2) contractional movements and (3) strike-slip movements. Different sets and distributions of joints, faults and folds are confirmed with effect of several deformational stages of the area and formation of the flower structure.
