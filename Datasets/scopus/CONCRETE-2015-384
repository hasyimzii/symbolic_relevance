Modeling of compressive and flexural strength for incremental replacement of natural sand with artificial sand in concrete




 
Experimental results based analysis of compressive and flexural strength of concrete acquired with combination of artificial sand and natural sand, utilizing indigenously prepared concrete mixture in the laboratory is reported. Parametric analysis has made based on Taguchi methodology. The mathematical models have also been developed to correlate compressive strength and average flexural strength with different three parameters. There is consistent increase in strength of concrete by replacing natural sand with artificial sand up to 65%. Percentage increase in strength is maximum for M20 grade and gradually reducing for M40 grade. The developed mathematical model is significant to represent the relationship and useful to predict the values for compression and flexural strength of the concrete. Adequacy of developed mathematical model has also been tested by conducting different verification experiments and it is observed that difference between predicted and observed value of compression and flexural strength are lying within 5% and 9% respectively.
