Engineering properties of the pozzolanic materials concrete (PMC) in a hotspring environment




 
Â© 2015 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. Taiwan has an extensive natural hotspring environment along with a significantly changing hotspring geology, which significantly influences the durability of building concrete in a hotspring environment. One such method may be the addition of furnace slag and fly ash; such mixtures represent recycling green building materials, which promote energy savings and the reduction of carbon emissions. This study first used methods of systematic innovative TRIZ, blessing in disguise and composite materials, to enhance the durability of concrete with a fixed water-binder ratio (W/B = 0.5) for which the recycled material mixture replaced (0, 20, 40%) the mix proportion, and the new engineering and durability properties were discussed based on different environmental properties and different curing ages. The results of the study indicated that the addition of furnace slag and fly ash could provide low-coulomb through current and high resistance, thus enhancing the durability of concrete.
