Non-volcanic crustal movements of the northernmost Philippine Sea plate detected by the GPS-acoustic seafloor positioning




 
Â© 2015 Watanabe et al. Repeatedly performing the GPS-acoustic seafloor positioning, we first succeeded in detecting non-volcanic seafloor movements on the Philippine Sea plate (PHS) subducting along the Sagami Trough. At a seafloor geodetic site on the northernmost part of the PHS off the Boso Peninsula, we detected significant eastward motion with respect to the central part of the PHS. This is unaccountable by the coupling between the Pacific plate and the PHS along the Izu-Bonin (Ogasawara) Trench because it would cause the westward elastic deformation at BOSS. It is rather consistent with the rigid motion of the tectonic block in the fore-arc along the Izu-Bonin Trench, associated with the back-arc rift. The other site on the western side of the Sagami Bay had moved toward the north relative to the Izu Peninsula. It suggests that the Izu microplate obviously moves relative to the northern PHS. The difference between the velocities of the Sagami Bay and the Izu Peninsula indicates the coupling on the boundary fault as well.
