Spaces of calculation, calculating space: Geographies of financial economization | [Räume der Kalkulation, Kalkulation des Raumes: Geographien der finanziellen Ökonomisierung]




 
Utilizing the concept of financial economization and the empirical examples of the asset classes farmland and real estate, this paper shows that the mobilization of capital in the domain of portfolio management hinges upon boundary drawing, legitimization and rationalization practices that align the properties and historical time of the natural and built environment with the frames of valuation and time of financial markets. In practice, these activities resemble a constant (re)negotiation of investment horizons.
