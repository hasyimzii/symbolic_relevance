Evolution of the oceanic lithosphere inferred from Po/So waves traveling in the Philippine Sea Plate

Po/So waves are characterized by their high-frequency content and long-duration travel over great distances (up to 3000km) through the oceanic lithosphere. Po/So waves are developed by the multiple forward scattering of P and S waves due to small-scale stochastic random heterogeneities. To study the nature of these heterogeneities, Po/So waves are analyzed in the Philippine Sea Plate, which consists of three regions with different lithospheric ages. In the Philippine Sea Plate, Po/So waves propagate in the youngest region (15 Ma) and propagate more effectively in older regions. We investigate the mechanism of this propagation efficiency using numerical finite difference method simulations of 2-D seismic wave propagation. The results of this study demonstrate that the increase in propagation efficiency of Po/So waves depends on the age of the oceanic lithosphere, and this relationship can be qualitatively explained by thickening of the oceanic lithosphere including small-scale heterogeneities and a reduction in the intrinsic attenuation. These small-scale heterogeneities may form continuously in oceanic lithosphere from the time of its formation at a spreading ridge, via the solidification of melts distributed in the asthenosphere.
