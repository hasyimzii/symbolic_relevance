Analysis of the composite effect of partially concrete-encased H-shaped steel composite columns




 
Â© 2015 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. To research the composite effect of partially concrete-encased composite columns, the axial compression analysis of three groups of 12 specimens (six H-shape steel partially concreteencased composite columns and six H-shape steel columns) was conducted by using the commercial finite element software ANSYS. The results show that partially concrete-encased composite columns possess sound mechanical performance as demonstrated by higher ultimate strength, deformability, stability and lateral stiffness than bare steel columns. The total cross-section of concrete and steel of partially concrete-encased composite columns both yield when specimens are damaged, showing better compatibility for deformation. Partially concreteencased composite provides good restraint for H-shaped steel to prevent local buckling, and the H-shaped steel confines the concrete, increasing its strength and ductility. Moreover, there is superior interaction effect between the concrete and the steel.
