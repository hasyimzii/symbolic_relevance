Differences in properties and proteomes of the midribs contribute to the size of the leaf angle in two near-isogenic maize lines
						 




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. The midrib of maize leaves provides the primary support for the blade and is largely associated with leaf angle size. To elucidate the role of the midrib in leaf angle formation, the maize line Shen137 (larger leaf angle) and a near isogenic line (NIL, smaller leaf angle) were used in the present study. The results of the analysis showed that both the puncture forces and proximal collenchyma number of the midribs of the first and second leaves above the ear were higher in NIL than in Shen137. Comparative proteomic analysis was performed to reveal protein profile differences in the midribs of the 5th, 10th and 19th newly expanded leaves between Shen137 and NIL. Quantitative analysis of 24 identified midrib proteins indicated that the maximum changes in abundance of 22 proteins between Shen137 and NIL appeared at the 10th leaf stage, of which phosphoglycerate kinase, adenosine kinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and adenylate kinase were implicated in glycometabolism. Thus, glycometabolism might be associated with leaf angle formation and the physical and mechanical properties of the midribs. These results provide insight into the mechanism underlying maize leaf angle formation.
