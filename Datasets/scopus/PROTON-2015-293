Synthesis of novel 1,2,3-triazole-containing pyridine–pyrazole amide derivatives based on one-pot click reaction and their evaluation for potent nematicidal activity against Meloidogyne incognita




 
© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht In order to find a novel, leading nematicide compound, a series of pyridine–pyrazole amide derivatives containing 1,2,3-triazoles were synthesized via click chemistry in a one-pot reaction. Their structures were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H NMR), 13C NMR, 19F NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Preliminary bioassays showed that most of the synthesized compounds exhibited good inhibitory activity in vivo against Meloidogyne incognita at 25 mg L−1. Among the tested compounds, 3a, 3e, 3f, 3g, 3j, 3m, 3q, 3s, 3t, 3v and 3w exhibited 100 % inhibition rates. Moreover, 3k displayed a 92.4 % inhibitory activity at 10 mg L−1. This investigation suggested that this pyridine–pyrazole amide containing a 1,2,3-triazole scaffold could be further optimized to explore novel, high-bioactivity nematicidal leads.
