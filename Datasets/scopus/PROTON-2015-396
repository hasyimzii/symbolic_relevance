New Chiral Benzimidazoles Derived from 1,2-Diaminocyclohexane




 
© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart·New York-Synthesis 2015. A simple synthesis of new enantiomeric benzimidazoles was developed. Starting from readily available enantiomeric trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane, the respective products were obtained in 3-4 steps in moderate to fair yields. A series of ten benzimidazoles substituted at the position 2 with alkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl groups were prepared.
