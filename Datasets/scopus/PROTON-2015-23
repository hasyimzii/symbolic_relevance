Measurement of 197Au(n,γ)198gAu reaction cross-section at the neutron energies of 1.12, 2.12, 3.12 and 4.12 MeV




 
© 2015 Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston. The 197Au(n, γ)198Au reaction cross-sections at the neutron energies of 1.12, 2.12, 3.12 and 4.12 MeV were determined by using activation and off-line γ-ray spectrometric technique. The mono-energetic neutron energies of 1.12-4.12 MeV were generated from the 7Li(p, n) reaction by using the proton energies of 3 and 4 MeV from the folded tandem ion beam accelerator (FOTIA) at BARC as well as 5 and 6 MeV from the Pelletron facility at TIFR, Mumbai. The 115In(n,γ)116mIn reaction cross-section was used as the neutron flux monitor. The 197Au(n, γ)198Au reaction cross-section at the neutron energies of 3.12 and 4.12 MeV are reported for the first time. The 197Au(n, γ)198Au reaction cross-sections at 1.12 and 2.12 MeV are close to the literature data of in between neutron energies. The 197Au(n, γ)198Au cross-section was also calculated theoretically by using the computer code TALYS 1.6 and found to be higher than the experimental data of present work and literature data within the neutron energies of 0.8 to 4 MeV.
