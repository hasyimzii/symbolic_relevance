Facile Synthesis of 4-Oxo-4 H -quinolizine-2-carboxamide Derivatives




 
Copyright Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. A facile synthetic method for the construction of 2-substituted-4-oxo-4H-quinolizine-based core structure has been successfully developed. The synthesis made use of a one-pot Stobbe condensation followed by cyclization starting from the commercially available 2-pyridinecarbaldehyde. The structure of the formed 4-oxo-4H-quinolizine-2-carboxylate was fully confirmed by mass spectra, 1H NMR and 13C NMR, correlation spectrography, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation, and heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra. The ethyl carboxylate moiety was then further functionalized via direct aminolysis by a range of amines to afford the corresponding 4-oxo-4H-quinolizine-2-carboxamides 4a-i in moderate to good yields.
