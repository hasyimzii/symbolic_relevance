Synthesis of Nitriles from Aldoximes and Primary Amides Using XtalFluor-E




 
© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart·New York-Synthesis 2015. The dehydration reaction of aldoximes and amides for the synthesis of nitriles using [Et2NSF2]BF4 (XtalFluor-E) is described. Overall, the reaction proceeds rapidly (normally <1 h) at room temperature in an environmentally benign solvent (EtOAc) with only a slight excess of the dehydrating agent (1.1 equiv). A broad scope of nitriles can be prepared, including chiral nonracemic ones. In addition, in a number of cases, further purification of the nitrile after the workup was not required.
