Calcium-dependent regulation of photosynthesis




 
					
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Abstract The understanding of calcium as a second messenger in plants has been growing intensively over the last decades. Recently, attention has been drawn to the organelles, especially the chloroplast but focused on the stromal Ca2 + transients in response to environmental stresses. Herein we will expand this view and discuss the role of Ca2 + in photosynthesis. Moreover we address of how Ca2 + is delivered to chloroplast stroma and thylakoids. Thereby, new light is shed on the regulation of photosynthetic electron flow and light-dependent metabolism by the interplay of Ca2 +, thylakoid acidification and redox status. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Chloroplast biogenesis.
