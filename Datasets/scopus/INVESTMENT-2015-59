Product market competition and corporate investment: Evidence from China




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. We find a positive relation between product market competition and corporate investment using a sample of Chinese manufacturing firms during 1999-2010. A quasi-natural experiment and change regressions yield consistent evidence. We postulate that China's high and predictable growth rate, as it transitions from a developing economy to a developed economy, is what drives the positive relation between competition and investment. We directly test and provide support for this growth-oriented explanation. We also find that high investment under high competition is a value-enhancing proposition for firms. Finally, we test whether some firm types are more likely to invest under high competition in a growing economy, and we find that firms with high predation risk and firms that are industry leaders invest more.
