A link of steel. The Western Europe-Russia gas pipeline network in the post-soviet era

However, its importance has steadily grown during recent decades, reaching the point that gas trade is currently considered one of the key political issues at the regional level. The relevance of natural gas is driven by several factors: it is cheaper than oil and less emitting than coal for power generation; it is cleaner than other fossil fuels for heating; and finally it is reliable and always available for final use, unlike discontinuous renewables. Coupling all these features with large reserves and low production costs created the basis for natural gas penetration in the European market. While generally representing a cheaper alternative to other technologies, in particular liquefaction of gas and transport via tanker, pipelines also entail a strong rigidity in natural gas supplies. Indeed, once built, pipeline indissolubility connects one field to a final market, or a few fields to a few final markets. Considering that a pipeline is usually an investment involving several tens of billion euros, conceived to stay in place for at least several decades, the evolution of the pipeline network between Russia and Europe is particularly important not only for the energy trade it allows, but also for its impact on political dynamics at the regional level.
