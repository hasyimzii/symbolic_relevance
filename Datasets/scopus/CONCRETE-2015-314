Concrete-filled steel and steel tubular T-joints under cyclic in-plane bending




 
A series of tests on the concrete-filled and steel tubular T-joints under inplane bending cyclic loading are presented in this paper. Two steel tubes were welded to form T-joint specimens, and then the chord was filled with self-compact concrete. For each test specimen the chord was loaded in a constant compression while the brace was under quasi-static cyclic in-plane bending loading. In total three concrete filled steel T-joints and two pure steel T-joints were tested. The failure modes, hysteretic curves and ultimate strengths of test specimens were obtained. The failure modes of all specimens were punching shear failure of the chord. It was shown that the filled concrete greatly enhanced the stiffness, the yielding strength and the ultimate strengths of T-joints. The energy dissipation ratio of the specimens under cyclic loading was calculated. The energy dissipation ability of concrete-filled specimens was better than that of steel specimens. A method provided by ECCS was used to calculate the yield strength of the test specimens. The ultimate strengths predicted by current AISC Standard and API RP2A specifications were compared with the test results.
