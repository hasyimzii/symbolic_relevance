Detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the Neoproterozoic Qingshuuiang Formation in southeastern Guizhou and their geological significance




 
LA-ICP-MS U-Pb isotopic age from the Neoproterozoic Qingshuijiang Formation in the southeast of Guizhou were made and 56 effective groups of single detrital grained zircon U-Pb ages were obtained. It shows that the detrital zircon ages are primary distributed in the range of 934 Ma∼931 Ma, 855 Ma∼847 Ma, 827 Ma∼825 Ma, 805 Ma∼798 Ma, 785 Ma∼776 Ma and 767 Ma∼763 Ma, with weighted mean minimum age of 766 Ma. The age distribution has a distinct episodic style with obvious peaks, fully reflecting the magmatic and tectonic events since the Yangtze and Cathaysian plates converged. It reveals that the U-Pb age spectrum is similar to that of the western margin and northern margin of Yangtze Block, basically representing the characteristics of U-Pb age spectrum of the Yangtze block. Analysis of U-Pb age spectrum similarity indicates that the Yangtze Block and Tarim Block have a close affinity while the Yangtze Block and the North China Block have a poor one. The close affinity between the Yangtze Block and Cathaysian Block only occurred when they collided since 1000 Ma.
