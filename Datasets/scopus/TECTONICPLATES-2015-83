Active rollback in the Gibraltar Arc: Evidences from CGPS data in the western Betic Cordillera




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. The Gibraltar Arc, located in the western Mediterranean Sea, is an arcuate Alpine orogen formed by the Betic and Rif Cordilleras, separated by the Alboran Sea. New continuous GPS data (2008-2013) obtained in the Topo-Iberia stations of the western Betic Cordillera allow us to improve the present-day deformation pattern related to active tectonics in this collision area between the Eurasian and African plates. These data indicate a very consistent westward motion of the Betic Cordillera with respect to the relatively stable Iberian Massif foreland. The displacement in the Betics increases toward the south and west, reaching maximum values in the Gibraltar Strait area (4.27 mm/yr in Ceuta, CEU1, and 4.06 mm/yr in San Fernando, SFER), then progressively decreasing toward the northwestern mountain front. The recent geological structures and seismicity evidence moderate deformation in a roughly NW-SE to WNW-ESE compressional stress setting in the mountain frontal areas, and moderate extension toward the internal part of the cordillera. The mountain front undergoes progressive development of folds affecting at least up to Pliocene deposits, with similar recent geological and geodetical rates. This folded strip helps to accommodate the active deformation with scarce associated seismicity. The displacement pattern is in agreement with the present-day clockwise rotation of the tectonic units in the northern branch of the Gibraltar Arc. Our data support that the westward emplacement of the Betic Cordillera continues to be active in a rollback tectonic scenario.
