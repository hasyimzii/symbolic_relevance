Novel sulfonated polyimide/zwitterionic polymer-functionalized graphene oxide hybrid membranes for vanadium redox flow battery




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved. Hybrid membranes (SPI/ZGO) composed of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) and zwitterionic polymer-functionalized graphene oxide (ZGO) are fabricated via a solution-casting method for vanadium redox flow battery (VRB). Successful preparation of ZGO fillers and SPI/ZGO hybrid membranes are demonstrated by FT-IR, XPS and SEM, indicating that ZGO fillers is homogeneously dispersed into SPI matrix. Through controlling the interfacial interaction between SPI matrix and ZGO fillers, the physicochemical properties, e.g., vanadium ion barrier and proton transport pathway, of hybrid membranes are tuned via the zwitterionic acid-base interaction in the hybrid membrane, showing a high ion selectivity and good stability with the incorporated ZGO fillers. SPI/ZGO-4 hybrid membrane proves a higher cell efficiencies (CE: 92-98%, EE: 65-79%) than commercial Nafion 117 membrane (CE: 89-94%, EE: 59-70%) for VRB application at 30-80 mA cm-2. The assembled VRB with SPI/ZGO-4 membrane presents a stable cycling charge-discharge performance over 280 times, which demonstrates its excellent chemical stability under the strong acidic and oxidizing conditions. SPI/ZGO hybrid membranes show a brilliant perspective for VRB application.
