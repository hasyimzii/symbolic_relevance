Standardized extract of Ficus platyphylla reverses apomorphine-induced changes in prepulse inhibition and locomotor activity in rats




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.. Preparations of Ficus platyphylla are used in Nigeria's folk medicine to manage a plethora of diseases including, insomnia, psychoses, depression, epilepsy, pain and inflammation. In this study, we examined the effects of the standardized methanol extract of F. platyphylla stem bark (FP) on apomorphine-induced changes in prepulse inhibition and locomotor activity in rats, as well as on the retrieval of a conditioned reaction in one-way active avoidance in mice. FP did not affect basal prepulse inhibition, but significantly reduced locomotor activity. The apomorphine-induced prepulse inhibition deficit and hyperactivity were significantly reversed by co-administration of clozapine or FP. Furthermore, FP inhibited the retrieval of a conditioned avoidance reaction. Our results revealed that FP contains psychoactive ingredients with neuroleptic-like properties, thus supporting the isolation and development of the biologically active components of this medicinal plant as antipsychotic agents.
