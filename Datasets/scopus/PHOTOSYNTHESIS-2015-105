Molecular characterization of 5 chlorophyll a/b-binding protein genes from Panax ginseng Meyer and their expression analysis during abiotic stresses




 
Â© 2016 The Institute of Experimental Botany The chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (CAB) serves in both photosystems (PS), I and II, as a coordinator of antenna pigments in the light-harvesting complex (LHC). The CABs constitute abundant and important proteins in the thylakoid membrane of higher plants. In our study, five CAB genes, which contained full-length cDNA sequences from the 4-yearold ginseng leaves (Panax ginseng Meyer), were isolated and named PgCAB. Phylogenetic comparison of the members of the subfamily between ginseng and higher plants, including Arabidopsis, revealed that the putative functions of these ginseng CAB proteins were clustered into the different family of Arabidopsis CABs; two PgCABs in LHCII family and three PgCABs in LHCI family. The expression analysis of PgCABs consistently showed dark-dependent inhibition in leaves. Expression analysis during abiotic stress identified that PgCAB genes responded to heavy metal, salinity, chilling, and UV stresses differently, suggesting their specific function during photosynthesis. This is the first comprehensive study of the CAB gene family in P. ginseng.
