A new cerebroside from the fruiting bodies of Hericium erinaceus and its applicability to cancer treatment




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. A new cerebroside, cerebroside E (1) was isolated from the fruiting bodies of Hericium erinaceus (Hericiaceae). The structure of 1 was elucidated by a combination of extensive spectroscopic analyses, including extensive 2D NMR, HR-MS, and chemical reactions. Compound 1 was evaluated for its applicability to medicinal use in several human diseases using cell-based assays. As a result, compound 1 attenuated cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in LLC-PK1 cells and exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on angiogenesis in HUVECs. These results collectively reflect the beneficial effects of compound 1 in cancer treatment.
