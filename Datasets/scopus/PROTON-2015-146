Synthesis, biological activity evaluation and molecular docking studies of novel coumarin substituted thiazolyl-3-aryl-pyrazole-4-carbaldehydes




 
© 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. A novel series of coumarin substituted thiazolyl-3-aryl-pyrazole-4-carbaldehydes (4a-o) were synthesized via an efficient, one-pot multicomponent approach involving 3-(2-bromoacetyl)coumarins (1a-g), thiosemicarbazide (2) and substituted acetophenones (3a-c) utilizing Vilsmeier-Haack reaction condition with good yields. The title compounds structure was elucidated by spectroscopic data (IR, NMR and Mass) and elemental analysis. All the synthesized compounds were screened for their in vitro cytotoxic activity against MCF-7, DU-145 and HeLa cell lines and studied detailed about molecular interaction of probable target protein human microsomal cytochrome CYP450 2A6 using docking simulation. These coumarin derivatives were exhibiting moderate to appreciable cytotoxic activities. The compounds 4m and 4n exhibited significant cytotoxic activity with IC50 values having 5.75 and 6.25 μM against HeLa cell line. Similarly compound 4n also exhibiting good anti cancer property and antibacterial activity against DU-145 cell line and Gram negative bacterial strains.
