The clinical profile of children with ADHD that require OROS-methylphenidate combined with shorter-acting formulations




 
© 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien. Long-acting methylphenidate (MPH) formulations, including OROS-MPH, were found to be effective in alleviating ADHD symptoms throughout the day. However, sustained stimulant activity may lead to prolonged suppression of appetite and insomnia. In this study, we characterized the clinical profile of children and adolescents for whom a once-daily lower dose of OROS-MPH combined with a shorter-acting agent was more tolerable than single higher OROS-MPH dose. In our cohort of 128 children treated with OROS-MPH, 47 (36.7 %) better tolerated a lower dose of OROS-MPH combined with short-acting MPH formulations (Group I). Nevertheless, for the majority (81 patients—63.3 %), a standard single moderate dose of OROS-MPH was sufficient (Group II). The mean daily doses of MPH were: 0.83 ± 0.21 mg/kg for Group I and 1.06 ± 0.29 mg/kg for Group II. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of learning disorders, tic disorders, epilepsy and conduct disorders between these two groups. However, anxiety and marginally depression were more prevalent in Group I (46.8 and 9.7 %) than in Group II (27.2 and 1.2 %). Patients in Group I were also more tending to receive psychotherapy than patients in Group II.
