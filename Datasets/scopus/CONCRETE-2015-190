Steel reinforced grout systems for the strengthening of masonry structures




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Steel Reinforced Grout (SRG) systems, comprising Ultra High Tensile Strength Steel cords embedded in mortar matrix, are increasingly used for the strengthening of existing structures. Their mechanical properties, however, still need to be fully investigated in order to provide reliable values of tensile and bond strength, strain and stiffness for design purposes. With this aim, four SRG systems made of two textiles combined with two mortars were tested. The durability of the textiles, the tensile behaviour of the composites and the shear bond performance on different substrates, including historic and modern bricks and tuff units, were investigated. The role of the layout of the textile, the characteristics of the matrix and the properties of the substrate are discussed. Finally, test results are combined to derive engineering design parameters for different field applications.
