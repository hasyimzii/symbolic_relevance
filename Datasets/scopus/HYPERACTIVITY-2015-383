An investigation of the role of using IS/IT in the delivery of treatments for ADHD in university students




 
Â© 2016, IGI Global. All rights reserved. Over the last decade, the popularity of incorporating advances in information systems and information technology (IS/IT) has been steadily growing. IS/IT can improve the delivery for better intervention and treatment with many different mental illnesses; however, there appears to be great potential for IS/IT in the context of young adults with mental disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD affects approximately 11% of the university population; negatively impacting students' academic performance, study skills, and social life. The study design outlined in this paper suggests a possibility for the role of IS/IT in the delivery of treatments and management of ADHD in university students to be examined with the view to introduce IS/IT into the traditional treatment context. This research involves collecting data from psychologists in the form of semi-structured interviews and a grounded theory methodology using multiple cases is adopted.
