© Hogrefe Verlag, Göttingen 2015. Theoretical Background: The parenting factors negativity and control have been discussed in relation to both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorders (AD). Research Question: So far, it has not been clarified whetherADHDandAD are influenced by negative parenting in general or if specific parenting factors affect specific disorders. Method: Research from 1994 to 2014 was collected and systematically analyzed. Relations in general were examined and moderating factors were identified. Results: While childhoodADHD appears to be related to parental negativity, but partly also to parental control, childhoodAD is especially related to control. The results are moderated by several factors such as method of assessment (e. g., questionnaire vs. observation) and medication. Conclusion: Disorder-specific relations between child psychopathology and parenting factors stress the importance of comparative research on ADHD and AD and can have implications for disorder-specific therapy.
