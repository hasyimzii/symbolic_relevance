Geotectonic evolution of the Nihonkoku Mylonite Zone of north central Japan based on geology, geochemistry, and radiometric ages of the Nihonkoku Mylonites: Implications for Cretaceous to Paleogene tectonics of the Japanese Islands

The Nihonkoku Mylonite Zone (NMZ), which branches off from the Tanagura Tectonic Line (TTL), is regarded as one of the Cretaceous to Paleogene sinistral ductile shear zones, which distributes widely in the Japanese Islands. The NMZ is composed mainly of mylonites and gneissose rocks of hornblende-biotite granodiorite, biotite granodiorite, and biotite granite, derived from Late Cretaceous to Paleogene granitic rocks in the Ashio Belt, Inner Zone of Southwest Japan. Based on SHRIMP U-Pb ages of zircon and K-Ar ages of biotite and hornblende from the Nihonkoku Mylonites and related rocks, the magmas of the parent rocks of the Nihonkoku Mylonites and related rocks intruded and consolidated at 65 Ma, following mylonitization at ca. 53-63 Ma. This timing can be correlated to the low-temperature deformation that occurred after 60-70 Ma along the TTL after the main mylonitization. Also, mylonitization of the NMZ took place at almost same time of the final phase of ductile deformation along the Median Tectonic Line of SW Japan. The NMZ is regarded to have been formed with the Inner Shear Zone of the Ryoke Belt (RISZ), in the framework of sinistral tectonic movement of eastern margin of the Asian Continent, due to oblique subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Asian Continent. On the other hand, top-to-W shear in reverse fault sense of the RISZ is explained by transpressional tectonics due to the oblique subduction.
