Should we continue methylphenidate treatment despite orofacial or extremity dyskinesias?

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disease affecting 5.3% of school-aged children. Methylphenidate is the primary stimulant, which has been used widely more than 60 years to treat ADHD. In this paper 3 cases with orofacial and/or limb dyskinesia after methylphenidate administration are reported. In 2 of our patients, continuation of the methylphenidate treatment did not cause recurrent dyskinesia. We thought that despite dyskinetic side effects, in cases with normal IQ level, continuation of methylphenidate treatment may be safe and do not cause any recurrent dyskinetic movements. Despite dyskinesia, one more chance may be given to methylphenidate treatment.
