Maternal factors and the emotional and behavioural functioning of adolescents with chronic health conditions




 
© 2015 Taylor & Francis Purpose: This study investigated the association between mothers’ mental health and education and the emotional and behavioural functioning of adolescents with chronic health conditions over time. Methods: Data were drawn from an ongoing study. Study participants (N = 363) were recruited through eight children’s rehabilitation centres. Logistic regression models were estimated. Results: There were significantly reduced odds that girls would display clinical signs of hyperactivity/inattention one year later compared to boys when a maternal mental health condition was present (OR = 0.10; p < 0.01). Where low maternal education was present, girls were more likely to display peer relationship problems one year later (OR = 3.72; p < 0.01). For both genders, having a mother with less than a high school education was also associated with conduct problems one year later (OR = 2.89; p < 0.01). Conclusions: Findings support a link between maternal factors and emotional and behavioural functioning in adolescents with chronic conditions. A holistic and family-centred approach to assessment and service delivery is indicated.Implications for RehabilitationWhen conducting clinical assessments, service providers should consider associations between maternal education and mental health and the emotional and behavioural functioning of adolescents with chronic health conditions.A holistic and family-centred approach to assessment and service delivery is indicated to ensure adolescents with chronic conditions and their families receive support for interrelated needs.
