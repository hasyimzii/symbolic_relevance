Tectonics and geodynamics of the Tian Shan in the Middle and Late Paleozoic




 
Â© 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc. This work presents a model of the tectonic development and geodynamics of subduction processes of oceanic and continental crust, the formation of an accretionary prism, continental collision, the formation of the folded-nappe system, and the magmatic and sedimentation processes in the Tian Shan in the Middle and Late Paleozoic. Other models developed for this region are discussed.
