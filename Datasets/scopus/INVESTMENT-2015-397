This article investigates the working hours of women in the Brazilian labor market using data from Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílio (National Household Survey) or PNAD of 2011. A heckit model and double hurdle model are used to estimate the women’s participation in the workforce and hours worked. The main results indicate that marriage and motherhood reduce the women labor supply. However, education, head of household and access to childcare collaborate to raise female participation in the labor force. Spouse’s income collaborates to reduce female participation in the workforce. Finally, to encourage the entry of women into the labor market, the public policies should be directed to increase the investment in women’s education and in the childcare supply.
