Developing plate tectonics theory from oceanic subduction zones to collisional orogens




 
Â© 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Crustal subduction and continental collision is the core of plate tectonics theory. Understanding the formation and evolution of continental collision orogens is a key to develop the theory of plate tectonics. Different types of subduction zones have been categorized based on the nature of subducted crust. Two types of collisional orogens, i.e. arc-continent and continent-continent collisional orogens, have been recognized based on the nature of collisional blocks and the composition of derivative rocks. Arc-continent collisional orogens contain both ancient and juvenile crustal rocks, and reworking of those rocks at the post-collisional stage generates magmatic rocks with different geochemical compositions. If an orogen is built by collision between two relatively old continental blocks, post-collisional magmatic rocks are only derived from reworking of the old crustal rocks. Collisional orogens undergo reactivation and reworking at action of lithosphere extension, with inheritance not only in the tectonic regime but also in the geochemical compositions of reworked products (i.e., magmatic rocks). In order to unravel basic principles for the evolution of continental tectonics at the post-collisional stages, it is necessary to investigate the reworking of orogenic belts in the post-collisional regime, to recognize physicochemical differences in deep continental collision zones, and to understand petrogenetic links between the nature of subducted crust and post-collisional magmatic rocks. Afterwards we are in a position to build the systematics of continental tectonics and thus to develop the plate tectonics theory.
