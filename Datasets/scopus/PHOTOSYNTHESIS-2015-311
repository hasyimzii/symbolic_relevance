Chlorophyll b in angiosperms: Functions in photosynthesis, signaling and ontogenetic regulation




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier GmbH. Chlorophyll b (Chl. b) is an antenna chlorophyll. The binding of Chl. b by antenna proteins is crucial for the correct assembly of the antenna complexes in thylakoid membranes. Since the levels of the proteins of major and minor antenna are affected to different extents by Chl. b binding, the availability of Chl. b influences the composition and the size of antenna complexes which in turn determine the supramolecular organization of the thylakoid membranes in grana. Therefore, Chl. b synthesis levels have a major impact on lateral mobility and diffusion of membrane molecules, and thus affect not only light harvesting and thermal energy dissipation processes, but also linear electron transport and repair processes in grana. Furthermore, in angiosperms Chl. b synthesis affects plant functions beyond chloroplasts. First, the stability of pigment-protein complexes in the antennae, which depends on Chl. b, is an important factor in the regulation of plant ontogenesis, and Chl. b levels were recently shown to influence plant ontogenetic signaling. Second, the amounts of minor antenna proteins in chloroplasts, which depend on the availability of Chl. b, were recently shown to affect ABA levels and signaling in plants. These mechanisms can be examined in mutants where Chl. b synthesis is reduced or abolished. The dramatic effects caused by the lack of Chl. b on plant productivity are interpreted in this review in light of the pleiotropic effects on photosynthesis and signaling, and the potential to manipulate Chl. b biosynthesis for the improvement of crop production is discussed.
