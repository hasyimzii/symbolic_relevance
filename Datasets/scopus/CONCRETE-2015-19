High performance concrete with electric arc furnace slag as aggregate: Mechanical and durability properties




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. This paper investigates the feasibility of using Black/Oxidizing Electric Arc Furnace slag (EAF) as coarse aggregate to produce High Performance Concrete (HPC). Various experimental mixes have been produced, fully replacing natural coarse aggregates with EAF slag, varying the cement dosages and the water/cement ratios, and they have been characterized through a mechanical and microstructural campaign. For some mixtures also durability has been evaluated, through a study about chloride ingress into concrete matrix. Results indicate that the use of EAF slag improves concrete strength and durability, reaching C60/75 strength class without using any mineral additions and maintaining relatively high water/cement ratio.
