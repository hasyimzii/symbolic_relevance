Iridium-Catalyzed C-C Coupling of a Simple Propargyl Ether with Primary Alcohols: Enantioselective Homoaldol Addition via Redox-Triggered (Z)-Siloxyallylation




 
© 2015 American Chemical Society. A chiral iridium complex formed in situ from [Ir(cod)Cl]2 and (R)-H8-BINAP is found to catalyze the direct enantioselective C-C coupling of a simple propargyl ether, TIPSOCH2C-CH, with primary alcohols to form γ-hydroxy (Z)-enol silanes with uniformly high enantioselectivity and complete alkene (Z)-stereoselectivity. As corroborated by deuterium labeling studies, these studies represent the first examples of 1,2-hydride shift-enabled π-allyl formation in the context of iridium catalysis.
