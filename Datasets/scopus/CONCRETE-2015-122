Investigation on precast concrete paver block with waste tyre crumb rubber




 
© 2015 Taylor & Francis A test programme was carried out to investigate the feasibility of utilising waste tyre crumb rubber as a partial replacement for fine aggregate (river sand) in the precast concrete paver block (PCPB). This study examines the density, compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength, rebound number and ultrasonic pulse velocity of PCPB with waste tyre crumb rubber. A comparison is also made between controlled PCBP (without crumb rubber) and PCBP containing various percentages of crumb rubber. The replacement contents of crumb rubber are 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% by volume. M40 grade of concrete was used and the experimental investigation was carried out to evaluate the influence of crumb rubber for 7, 28 and 56 days study. The results indicated that there was a reduction in the density, compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength, rebound number and ultrasonic pulse velocity with the increase in crumb rubber content in the concrete mix. The results also revealed that up to 15% crumb rubber replacement by sand volume meets the target strength of 46.60 MPa, meaning that concrete containing crumb rubber content up to 15% is useful for making light weight concrete and is recommended for use in the paver block manufacture.
