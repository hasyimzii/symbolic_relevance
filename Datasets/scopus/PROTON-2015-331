Govanoside A, a new steroidal saponin from rhizomes of Trillium govanianum




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. A new spirostane steroidal saponin, govanoside A (1) along with three known compounds borassoside E (2) pennogenin (3) and diosgenin (4) were isolated from rhizomes of Trillium govanianum. Their structures were elucidated through 1D, 2D-NMR spectroscopic data analysis and acid hydrolysis. Compound (2) in genus Trillium and all compounds (1-4) in T. govanianum are reported herein for the first time. Furthermore, compounds 1 and 2 exhibited good to moderate activities against Aspergillus Niger ATCC 16888, Aspergillus flavus ATCC 9643, Candida albicans ATCC 18804, and Candida glabrata ATCC 90030. This is a significant finding keeping in view the limited antifungal drugs for aspergillosis and candidiasis.
