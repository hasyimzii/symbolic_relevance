Thymine-functionalized amphiphilic biodegradable copolymers for high-efficiency loading and controlled release of methotrexate




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. In this study, a novel thymine-functionalized six-membered cyclic carbonate monomer (TAC) was synthesized by the Michael-addition reaction between thymine and acryloyl carbonate (AC). The corresponding functional amphiphilic block copolymer mPEG-b-PTAC was further successfully synthesized by ring-opening polymerization using immobilized porcine pancreas lipase (IPPL) as the catalyst and mPEG as the macroinitiator. Meanwhile, mPEG-b-P(TAC-co-DTC) and mPEG-b-PDTC were also synthesized by the same enzymatic methods for comparison on different TAC contents. The structures of monomer and copolymers were characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and FTIR. All the amphiphilic block copolymers could self-assemble to form nano-sized micelles in aqueous solution. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation showed that the micelles dispersed in spherical shape with nano-size before and after MTX loading. 1H-NMR and FTIR results confirmed the successful formation of multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions between exposed thymine groups of hydrophobic PTAC segments and 2,6-diaminopyridine (DAP) groups of MTX molecules, which resulting in the higher drug loading capacity and the pH-sensitive drug release behavior. MTT assays also indicated lower toxicity of copolymer but higher potent cytotoxic activity of MTX-loaded copolymer against HeLa cells.
