Solid-supported reagents composed of a copolymer possessing 2-O-sulfonyl mannosides and phase-transfer catalysts for the synthesis of 2-fluoroglucose




 
We described the synthesis of a solid-supported co-polymer possessing mannosides and phase-transfer catalysts and synthesis of 2-fluoroglucoside from it. We first prepared a soluble copolymer from two allene monomers possessing a precursor for the synthesis of 2-fluoroglycose and a crown ether. The copolymerization of the monomers via the π-ally nickel-catalyst smoothly proceeded at room temperature to provide a desired copolymer without decomposition of the sulfonate esters. The copolymer exhibited high reactivity towards fluorination in comparison with a conventional precursor. We next synthesized the solid-supported copolymer by using the solid-supported initiator attached with TentaGel® resins. TentaGel® enabled polymerization under stirring with stirring bar without decomposition. The solid-supported copolymer exhibited comparable reactivity towards fluorination in comparison with the soluble copolymer. In addition, it can be easily separated from the reaction vessel by filtration.
