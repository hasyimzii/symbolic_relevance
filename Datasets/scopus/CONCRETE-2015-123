Experimental testing on emulative connections for precast columns using grouted corrugated steel sleeves




 
© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Seismic analysis of precast concrete structures requires specific information regarding the behaviour of the connections under large deformation cycles. If a connection is located within the critical region of a structural element, its energy dissipation capacity needs to be confirmed by experimental testing. The use of emulative connections for precast elements is attractive for designers because common conventional design methodologies and assumptions developed for cast in place structures may be readily used. The results of a structural testing program for precast columns connected using grouted corrugated steel sleeves are reported in this paper. A comparison with reference “cast in place” specimens is made and conclusions regarding the emulative characteristic of the connection are drawn. Tests were carried out on scaled concrete columns using the reaction frame at the Technical University of Civil Engineering of Bucharest. Four precast specimens and two reference specimens were tested. Analysis of the recorded data showed that the precast specimens have similar hysteretic response and energy dissipation capacity as the reference ones.
