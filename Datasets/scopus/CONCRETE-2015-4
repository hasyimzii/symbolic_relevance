Life-cycle cost analysis as a tool in the developing process for new bridge edge beam solutions




 
© 2016 Taylor & Francis Currently in Sweden, the life-cycle measures applied on bridge edge beams may take up to 60% of the total costs incurred along the road bridges’ life span. Moreover, significant disturbances for the road users are caused. Therefore, the Swedish Transport Administration has started a project to develop alternative edge beam design solutions that are better for society in terms of cost. The purpose of this article is to investigate whether these proposals can qualify for more detailed studies through an evaluation and comparison based on a comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis. The alternatives including the standard design are applied to typical Swedish bridges. The impact of the values of the parameters with the largest influence is investigated by sensitivity analyses. Results with different life-cycle strategies are shown. The positive influences in the total life-cycle cost of a stainless steel reinforced solution and of the enhanced construction technique are estimated. The concrete edge beam integrated with the deck seems to be favourable, which is in line with international experience observed. Different designs may be appropriate depending on the bridge case and the life-cycle strategy. The Swedish Transport Administration will carry out a demonstration project in a bridge with one of the proposals.
