Phytoplasmas change the source-sink relationship of field-grown sweet cherry by disturbing leaf function




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Changes in the function of field-grown sweet cherry leaves infected with phytoplasma were evaluated through the analysis of photosynthesis, respiration, carbohydrates and hormones. Phytoplasmal infection caused witches' broom, small leaves, leaf yellowing and leaf rolling. The photosynthesis of infected leaves was considerably reduced, and they were unable to produce sufficient carbohydrates for their own needs. In contrast, the starch content of infected leaves was significantly increased. These results demonstrate the change in the role of infected leaves from sources to sinks. Further analysis revealed that the photosynthetic decline was related to a significant decrease in photosynthetic pigments and to marked inactivation of photosystem II (PSII). Furthermore, the loss of PSII function was due to a decrease in chlorophyll content, reduction and closure of active reaction centers, and decline in photochemical efficiency.
