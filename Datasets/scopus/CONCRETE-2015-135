Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. This study examined the effect that the thin plate shape of the amorphous metallic fibers has on the attainability of the mixing conditions, the static mechanic properties, and the impact resistance of concrete and cement composites (mortar) to those of hooked-end steel fibers. The amorphous metallic fiber-reinforced concrete was found to lose a significant amount of its flowability as a result of mixing, relative to the hooked-end steel fiber reinforced concrete. The hooked-end steel fiber exhibited pull-out from the matrix after the peak pull-out load was attained, while the amorphous metallic fiber with the large bond-specific surface area was not pulled out from the matrix, but was instead cut off. In terms of impact resistance, the amorphous metallic fiber reinforced concrete was found to be more effective at resisting cracking than the hooked-end steel fiber reinforced concrete. Therefore, amorphous metallic fiber should be used in fiber reinforced cement composite materials and structures, for structural materials, and for protection panels.
