Salt stress response of membrane proteome of sugar beet monosomic addition line M14




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Understanding how plants respond to and tolerate salt stress is important for engineering and breeding effort to boost plant productivity and bioenergy in an ever challenging environment. Sugar beet M14 line is a unique germplasm that contains genetic materials from Beta vulgaris L. and Beta corolliflora Zoss, and it exhibits tolerance to salt stress. Here we report the changes in membrane proteome of the M14 plants in response to salt stress (0, 200, 400 mM NaCl) using an iTRAQ two-dimensional LC-MS/MS technology for quantitative proteomic analysis. In total, 274 proteins, mostly membrane proteins, were identified, and 50 proteins exhibited differential protein level changes, with 40 proteins increased and 10 decreased. The proteins were mainly involved in transport, metabolism, protein synthesis, photosynthesis, protein folding and degradation, signal transduction, stress and defense, energy, and cell structure. These results have revealed interesting mechanisms underlying the M14 response and tolerance to salt stress. Biological significance: Sugar beet monosomic addition line M14 is a special variety with salt stress tolerance. Analysis of the M14 membrane proteome under salt stress may provide useful information regarding specific adaptive mechanisms underlying salt stress tolerance. Membrane proteins are known to play critical roles in salt stress signaling and adaptation. The purpose of this study was to identify significantly changed membrane proteins and determine their possible relevance to salt tolerance. The proteomic analysis of the M14 line revealed important molecular mechanisms that can be potentially applied to improving crop salt tolerance.
