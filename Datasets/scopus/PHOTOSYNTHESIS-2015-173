UV Sensitivity of Vegetative and Reproductive Tissues of Two Antarctic Brown Algae is Related to Differential Allocation of Phenolic Substances




 
Â© 2015 The American Society of Photobiology. UV sensitivity of the vegetative and reproductive tissues of two Antarctic brown macroalgae was compared. Photosynthesis as well as the content and localization of phenolic substances were determined. Responses to UV radiation were quantified as chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm). Ascoseira mirabilis showed high UV tolerance, while in Cystosphaera jacquinotii Fv/Fm decreased by 15-21%, the receptacles being more tolerant than the vegetative blades. The phlorotannin contents showed an opposite pattern: the soluble fraction dominated in C. jacquinotii while in A. mirabilis the insoluble fraction was more abundant. Soluble phlorotannins were higher in the reproductive than in vegetative tissues in both species. Images of tissue cross-sections under violet-blue light excitation confirmed a high allocation of phenolic compounds (as blue autofluorescence) in C. jacquinotii, both in reproductive and vegetative blades. The allocation and proportions of the soluble and insoluble phlorotannins could be related with the observed UV tolerance of the vegetative and reproductive tissues.
