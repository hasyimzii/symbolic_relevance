Dynamic behavior of nonautonomous cellular neural networks with time-varying delays




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. In this paper, we investigate the dynamic behavior of nonautonomous cellular neural networks with time-varying delays. We firstly develop a differential inequality which plays an important role in study of boundedness, attracting set and stability of differential systems and improves some early Halanay-type inequalities. Based on the new inequality, the boundedness, attracting set, exponential stability and existence of periodic solution of the considered neural networks are obtained. Our results improve the early results in the literature. One example is given to illustrate the correctness and superiority of our conclusion.
