BODIPY-Coumarin Conjugate as an Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Fluidity Sensor and Its Application to ER Stress Models




 
Â© 2015 American Chemical Society. An endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-selective chemosensor composed of BODIPY and coumarin moieties and a long alkyl chain (n-C18) was synthesized. The emission ratio of BODIPY to coumarin depends on the solution viscosity. The probe is localized to the ER membrane and was applied to reveal the reduced ER membrane fluidity under ER stress conditions.
