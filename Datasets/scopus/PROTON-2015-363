The present study reports a renoprotective effect and the mechanism of action of lupane triterpenes isolated from Cornus walteri in cisplatin-induced renal toxicity. A phytochemical investigation of the MeOH extract of the stems and stem bark of C. walteri resulted in the isolation and identification of twelve lupane triterpenes. Among these, betulinic acid, 29-oxobetulinic acid, betulin 3-acetate, and lupeol ameliorated cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity to 80% of the control value at 125 μM. Upregulated phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 following cisplatin treatment were markedly decreased after co-treatment with betulinic acid, 29-oxobetulinic acid, betulin 3-acetate, and lupeol. In addition, the protein expression level of cleaved caspase-3 and the percentage of apoptotic cells were also significantly reduced after co-treatment with betulinic acid, 29-oxobetulinic acid, betulin 3-acetate, and lupeol. These results show that blocking the MAPK signaling cascade plays a critical role in mediating the renoprotective effect of betulinic acid, 29-oxobetulinic acid, betulin 3-acetate, and lupeol isolated from C. walteri extract.
