Using a three stage super-sbm model to analyze the influence of bank's internationalization and risk on the operational efficiency




 
Â© Hitotsubashi University. Thiss tudy appliesthe three stage Super-SBM model, which combinesthe approachesof Fried et al. (2002) and Tone (2002), to analyze the influence of banks' internationalization and ris k on efficiency. Most former works focused on the effects of risk, but they seldom emphasize the impact of internationalization. Therefore, in addition to the modification of the empirical model, this study also considers internationalization as an external factor into the efficiency measurement. The results show Taiwan'scommercial bankscould increase itsdegree of internationalization to improve efficiency, whether by using the strategy of foreign direct investment or increasing foreign shareholding. This study also evidences that several banks have a fine management capacity, but they are easily affected by external factorsto be defined asine fficient units.
