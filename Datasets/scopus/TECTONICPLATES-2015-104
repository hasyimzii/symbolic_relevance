Precambrian geodynamics (IV): Pre-plate regime




 
Â© 2015, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers. All right reserved. Precambrian geodynamics focuses on kinetics mechanism of sedimentation, magmatic, metamorphic and deformation, mantle and lithosphere of the Earth during 4.56-0.543 Ga, being the eternal frontier and research focus of Earth Science. The present-day study shows that the early Precambrian tectonics is difficult to adopt the theory of plate tectonics to be interpreted reasonably; origin time of plate tectonics through the Earth history may vary at various positions, but the mainstream understanding is that the plate tectonics regime occurred during 2.7-2.1 Ga, and so is the North China Craton. The pre-plate regimes appearing before plate tectonics has been proposed, including many kinds of understanding: mantle plume, mantle overturn, gravitational tectonics, and platelets, of which the gravitational tectonics was considered at the stage of layering or stratification on the Earth in the Hadean, especially 4.54-4.45 Ga of the core formation and mantle magma ocean. So far, for the origin of oval structures of crustal levels, there are 8 original models: diapirism, middle-lower crust flow, horizontal channel flow, polyphase fold superposition, deformation partitioning, cracking-sag subduction, multilayer top-down rheological flow and batholith intrusion-derived buckling-partitioning, they all can appear under extension, compression and strike slipping backgrounds. No matter what both plate tectonics and pre-plate regimes, global tectonic process seems to be top-down mechanism.
