2015 IEEE 17th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing, MMSP 2015




 
The proceedings contain 90 papers. The topics discussed include: action recognition using multi-layer depth motion maps and sparse dictionary learning; an ensemble of invariant features for person re-identification; traffic flow matching with clique and triplet; learning query and image similarities with listwise supervision; learning-based movie summarization via role-community analysis and feature fusion; query-adaptive late fusion with neural network for instance search; deep matrix factorization for social image tag refinement and assignment; popular song summarization using chorus section detection from audio signal; large scale multi-class classification using latent classifiers; automatic liver segmentation from CT images using latent semantic indexing; and fast simultaneous video encoder for adaptive streaming.
