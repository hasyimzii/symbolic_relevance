Dynamic behavior of concrete under passive confinement




 
Â© 2015, Editorial Departmentof CJAM. All right reserved. Based on the concrete Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) test, numerical models of concrete under passive confinement are established by the finite element software ANSYS/LS-DYNA. Through the comparative analysis of 20 groups date for the dynamic mechanical properties of concrete under different confining pressure and strain rate, the influence rules of confining pressure and strain rate on the concrete failure mode, the stress-strain curve, the ultimate strength and the strain peak are obtained. Results obtained indicate the following facts, with the increase of the strain rate, the failure modes of concrete shift gradually from splitting to crushing, and the bigger the passive confinement is, the more sufficient the concrete strength is played. When the strain rate increases from 0 to 126.47, the dynamic strength and strain of concrete with no confining pressure increased 2.74 times and 1.95 times respectively, while those under passive confinement increased 1.93 times and 1.39 times respectively. When the confining pressure within the scope of OMPa to 6.93MPa, the dynamic ultimate strength of concrete increases limited and tends to be stable when the confining pressure is about 4MPa, while the increase factor of the strain grows linearly as the confining pressure increases.
