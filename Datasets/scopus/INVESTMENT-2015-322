The Financial Performance of Socially Responsible Investments: Insights from the Intertemporal CAPM




 
© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht This study formulates a two-factor empirical model under the intertemporal CAPM framework to evaluate the cross-sectional implications of socially responsible investments in the US equity market. Our results show that socially responsible investments have no asset pricing impact on the US market. We argue that this ‘no financial impact’ finding indicates that investors will not be disadvantaged financially by investing in socially responsible funds or corporations.
