Pharmocologic treatment with histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor (ACY-738) recovers Alzheimer's disease phenotype in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice




 
Â© 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. Introduction Current therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) focuses on delaying progression, illustrating the need for more effective therapeutic targets. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) modulates tubulin acetylation and has been implicated as an attractive target. HDAC6 is also elevated in postmortem tissue samples from patients. However, HDAC6 inhibitors have had limited success preclinically due to low blood-brain barrier penetration. Method We investigated a specific, potent HDAC6 inhibitor (ACY-738) in a mouse model of AD. We determined the effects of ACY-738 treatment on axonal transport, behavior, and pathology in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 mice. Results We demonstrated improvements in in vivo axonal transport in two treatment groups as a result of ACY-738 brain levels. We also demonstrated recovery of short-term learning and memory deficits, hyperactivity, and modifications of tau and tubulin. Discussion Our findings implicate specific, targeted HDAC6 inhibitors as potential therapeutics and demonstrate that further investigations are warranted into effects of HDAC6 inhibitors in AD.
