Bis azide-triphenylphosphine as a reagent for esterification at room temperature




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Modified Staudinger reaction is a well-established reaction for the amide synthesis from organic azides and carboxylic acids in the presence of phosphorous reagents. In contrary to this, it is notable that bis azide in the presence of triethylphosphite or trimethylphosphite does not afford the expected bis amides but affords the ethyl or methyl esters of the carboxylic acids respectively. This serendipitous observation when further investigated results in the discovery of bis azide-triphenylphosphine as an efficient reagent for esterification at room temperature.
