Electrical model of building structures under ground-fault conditions. Part II




 
Â© 2015 IEEE. This paper presents the results of field measurements of touch voltages occurring in buildings under ground-fault conditions, as well as of resistance-to-ground of edifices of different nature (i.e. masonry, reinforced concrete). The goal of this experimental study was to confirm that ground-fault potential profiles and touch voltages in buildings do depend on the make-up of the structure, the floor material, the configuration and location of the grounding electrodes with respect to the point of touch, and the presence of metalwork (e.g. metal pipes) bonded to the ground system. The results of the above measurements, involving buildings of different construction type, are herein presented and discussed, and were obtained following the analytical models illustrated in Part I of this paper.
