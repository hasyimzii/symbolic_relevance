Full-circle monitoring and stability study of bfrp concrete columns




 
© 2015, Engineering Mechanics Press. All right reserved. A 360° full-circle deformation measurement system is applied for monitoring the destruction and deformation of the concrete columns packaged with basalt fiber reinforced plastic (BFRP). This system is made up of four groups of three dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) subsystems, consisting of eight cameras. By encircling the columns being tested in the middle, the system can measure these specimens, which are subjected to large deformation with large curvature, discretely. Different hardware control methods are adopted to capture pictures synchronously. Through an investigation of the view field and a comparison of the strain calculated by 3D-DIC with that measured by strain gauges, the stability of the system is tested and verified. In the compression experiments conducted on the concrete columns packaged with BFRP, full-circle monitoring of the destruction and deformation is obtained. The results show that 360° full-circle deformation measurement system can effectively track damage in concrete columns packaged with BFRP and meet the demands of large deformation measurement.
