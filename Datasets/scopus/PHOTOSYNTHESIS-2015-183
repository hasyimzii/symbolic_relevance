Similarities and differences in wheat plant responses to low temperature and cadmium




 
Â© 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc. A comparative study was performed on the accumulation of biomass, dynamics of indicators of the activity of photosynthetic apparatus, and cold tolerance in the seedlings of frost-tolerance wheat varieties under the effect of a low hardening temperature and cadmium. It was found that the plant responses to the effects of the stressors studied are similar: an increase in cold tolerance of leaves, slowing rates of plant growth and photosynthesis, and increased non-photochemical fluorescence quenching were observed in both cases. At the same time, it was noted that the plant responses to the actions of low temperature and Cd have certain differences associated with the negative effect of Cd on growth and photosynthetic activity.
