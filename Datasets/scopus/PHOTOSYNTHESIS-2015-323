The Response of Physiological Characteristics, Expression of OSC Genes, and Accumulation of Triterpenoids in Betula platyphylla Sukto MeJA and SA Treatment




 
© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York The pentacyclic triterpenoids from birch (Betula platyphylla suk) have broad pharmacological activities and can be potentially used for the development of anti-cancer and anti-AIDS drugs. In this study, we explored the effects of spraying 3-year-old white birch with different concentration of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA) on the expression of key genes in triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways and on the accumulation and physiological characteristics of triterpenoids in birch saplings. The results showed that spraying different concentration of MeJA and SA could obviously promote accumulation of total triterpenoids in 3-year-old white birch. The triterpenoid content in the stem bark was increased by 46.11 %, reaching 81.86 mg/g, after 1 day of treatment with 1 mmol·L−1 MeJA (MJ2), and by 45.07 %, reaching 91.4 mg/g, after 14 days of treatment with 5 mmol·L−1 SA (SA1). In addition, MeJA and SA treatment increased the contents of chlorophyll a and b, antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), as well as photosynthetic performance, and affected the content of soluble sugar and soluble protein in birch leaf. Fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results showed that MeJA and SA treatment deferentially enhanced the key gene expression of cycloartenol synthase (BPX and BPX2), lupeol synthase (BPW) and beta-amyrin synthase (BPY) in triterpenoid synthesis pathway in birch bark and leaves. The results showed that MeJA and SA induced triterpenoid synthesis of birch plant is closely related with not only the expression of key genes of triterpenoid synthesis pathway but also photosynthesis, anti-stress response and physiological indexes, suggesting that regulation of triterpenoid synthesis of birch by MeJA and SA may involve in more complex mechanisms at physiological and molecular levels.
