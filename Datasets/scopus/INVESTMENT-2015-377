The aim of this paper is to shed light on the divergence of economic historiography on production, investment and profitability of the machinery and equipment industry in Brazil and São Paulo in the period of the First World War through the evolution of the industry from 1900 to 1920, using original primary sources. The main sources are the contracts, amendments and dissolutions filed in the Sao Paulo Trade Board between 1911 and 1920. These contracts are records of business formation in societies of entrepreneurs from every branch of economic activity in the state of São Paulo. The main results of the effects of the First World War for the machinery and equipment industry in São Paulo were decrease in investment, increased in production, rising domestic demand due to drop in imports, and increased in profitability of the companies that resulted in an environment incentive for the foundation of new small businesses (workshops). Some of these companies increased their investment post-war.
