To solve the problems of the large volume and high cost of concrete in the penetration test, the structure equivalent of concrete was studied. The process of the kinetic-energy projectile vertically penetrating concrete target was simulated by using three-dimensional calculation software programs. According to the calculation results, the impact of projectile and target diameter-ratio on penetration was analyzed. The influence of boundary can be ignored when the diameter-ration between target and missile is equal or greater than 30, which is equivalent to the semi-infinite target. The results show that the circumferential constraints of concrete target can reduce the impact of the boundary effect on penetration capability, and the different enhancement restraint can further reduce the diameter of target body to reduce the radial dimension. The quantitative relationship was given. The study has important reference value to reduce the test cost.
