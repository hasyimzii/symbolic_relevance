Simple Solubilization of the Traditional 2,2′:6′,2′′-Terpyridine Ligand in Organic Solvents by Substitution with 4,4′′-Di- tert -butyl Groups




 
© 2015 Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart New York Synthesis. A simple one-pot procedure is described for the synthesis and purification of 4′-substituted 4,4′′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine ligands. The new series of ligand display improved solubility in most organic solvents in comparison to traditional 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine ligands.
