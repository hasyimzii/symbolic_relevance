Investigation of the reliability of nonlinear modeling approaches to capture the residual displacements of RC columns under seismic loading




 
Â© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. The objective of this study is to develop modeling strategies to accurately model column behavior under seismic loading, including residual displacement. To this end, seven shaking table tests are considered to evaluate the accuracy of existing modeling approaches in capturing residual displacement, maximum displacement and base shear. It is found that, although the recommended modeling strategies can estimate maximum displacement and maximum base shear with reliable accuracy, but the discrepancy of their results corresponding to residual displacement are unacceptable. Following this, a modified concrete constitute model representing damage accumulation from cyclic loading is implemented for the fiber-element analysis. Analyses using modified concrete constitute model leads to decrease the error of modeling strategies in capturing residual displacement.
