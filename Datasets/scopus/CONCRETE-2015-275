Sulphate ion migration of cement concrete under the coupling action of corrosion solution and alternating loading




 
Â© 2015 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. In this paper, the sulphate ion migration process of concrete under the coupling action of alternating loading and sulphate corrosion is investigated. Chemical analysis method is used to investigate the sulphate ion migration process of interior concrete. The results show that compared with the static loading and the no loading, the alternating loading can accelerate the sulphate ion migration in the cement concrete which is subjected to sulphate attack. The sulphate ion concentration on the surface of concrete under alternating loading is higher than static loading. With the increase of depth, the difference between the alternating loading and the static loading becomes smaller gradually. When the stress level is greater than 40%, the sulphate ion diffusion is improved obviously. It is also found that on the condition of that water-cement ratio met requirements of the concrete workability, low water-cement ratio will improve the durability of concrete under the coupling action of alternating loading and sulphate corrosion.
