Eastern mediterranean: Combined geological-geophysical zonation and paleogeodynamics of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic structural-sedimentation stages




 
Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. The eastern Mediterranean, in the Neo-Tethyan collision zone, consists mainly of the Mesozoic terrane belt and the adjoining oceanic crust complex of the northern part of the Sinai plate. The recent discovery of large hydrocarbon deposits has attracted considerable attention to this region. Combined analysis of gravity, magnetic, paleomagnetic, tectonic, structural and paleogeographical data sheds light on the tectonic evolution of this region. The Kiama paleomagnetic zone of inverse polarity, discovered in the oceanic crust of the eastern Mediterranean suggests transport along transform faults from the eastern part of the Tethys Ocean. The discrepancy between the terrane belt and the Nubian-Arabian foreland, oceanic crust, and terrane belt testify to the allochthonous nature of the eastern Mediterranean. For the first time, formation-paleogeographical maps of structural stages from the Triassic to the Neogene-Quaternary have been compiled. The integrated tectono-geophysical and paleogeographical specifics of deep zonation call for a reevaluation of regional criteria for oil and gas exploration.
