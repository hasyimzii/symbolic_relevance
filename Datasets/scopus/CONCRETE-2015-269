Briefing: Testing times for concrete structures - is BS 1881-124 still fit for purpose?




 
© 2015, Thomas Telford Services Ltd. All rights reserved. In co-operation with 11 testing laboratories, the Concrete Society recently undertook a laboratory trial of BS 1881-124: Chemical analysis methods for hardened concrete. The trial was supervised by a Concrete Society working group as part of a 4-year-long revision of the first edition of Concrete Society Technical Report 32, Analysis of Hardened Concrete: A Guide to Test Procedures and Interpretation of Results. The trial findings have cast significant doubt on the accuracy of test methods that are routinely used during condition investigations of concrete infrastructure. This briefing by the working group’s chairman and secretary presents summarised findings of the trial and discusses the implications for those concerned with designing, investigating and maintaining concrete structures.
