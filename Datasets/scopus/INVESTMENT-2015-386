Heterogeneous treatment effects in development policy evaluation: The case of the Mexican Estrategia 100×100




 
© 2015. A recent evaluation of the Mexican interinstitutional coordination program Estrategia 100×. 100, published by Coneval in 2013, did not find many satisfactory results with respect to its target population. However, in Coneval's evaluation all statistical quantities of interest were computed at the group level only, thereby overlooking individual within-group heterogeneity. In this paper we estimate the heterogeneity of these treatment effects as a function of the level of investment per capita received through the program's actions. We provide evidence that the program was in fact effective whenever it was accompanied by the required investment.
