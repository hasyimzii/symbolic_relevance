Improving the treatment outcomes for ADHD patients with IS/IT: An actor-network theory perspective




 
Â© 2016 by IGI Global. All rights reserved. The key role for IS/IT in e-health has now been well established; however, within e-health the area of e-mental health is still new and emerging and scholars and practitioners alike are dubious as to the role for IS/IT and its benefits. We propose using Actor-network Theory (ANT) to assist in understanding the enabling role in e-mental health and we focus on one area of mental health, adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We focus on Saudi Arabia. Attention to ADHD has begun to gain growing attention from Saudi Arabia healthcare providers and researchers. Currently, there is an estimated 15% of school age children suffering from ADHD. More than half of these children are expected to continue to show the symptoms of ADHD through their adolescence and adulthood. ADHD impacts the quality of life these individuals. Technology has the potential to improve mental health services this can be seen in enabling early intervention or treatment for people with mental health issues. Saudi Arabia is investing heavily in e-health and aiming to build a complete patient electronic record by 2020.
