Multi-dimensional exploration of the characteristics of emotional regulation in children with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder




 
Objective To explore the characteristics of emotional regulation in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods Two hundred and eighty-two children who were diagnosed as ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) were recruited from the child psychiatric clinic of Peking University Sixth Hospital/Institute of Mental Health from August 2012 to April 2014. And 260 normal children from the local primary schools were selected as the healthy control group. The emotional factors or items of Conners' Parent Rating Scale, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Rutter Children Behavior Questionnaire were used to assess the characteristics of emotional regulation multi-dimensionally. Results After controlling for the effects of age, sex and intelligence quotient (IQ), in Conner scale, the emotional lability (EL) scores of ADHD group were significantly higher than that of healthy control group [ (4. 3 ±2. 6) vs (1. 4 ± 1. 5), P < 0. 001 ]. In BRIEF scale, the emotional control (ECTRL) scores of ADHD group were significantly higher than that of control group [ (16. 1 ±4.4) vs (12. 0 ± 2. 5), P < 0. 001 ] . In CBCL scale, the deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) scores of ADHD group were significantly higher than that of control group [ (26. 8 ± 11.0) vs (6. 6±6. 8), P < 0.001]. In Rutter questionnaire, the emotional symptoms (ES) scores of ADHD group were significantly higher than that of control group [(2. 7 ±2. 0) vs (1.7 ±1.5), P < 0. 001 ] . Based on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, the area under the curve (AUG) of EL was 0.84 with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 0. 81 -0. 87. The AUC of ECTRL was 0. 81 with 95% 67 0. 77 -0. 84. The AUG of DESR was 0.95 with 95% CI 0.93 - 0.97. The AL'C of ES was 0.66 with 95% CI 0.61 - 0. 70. Conclusions The study multi-dimensionally indicated that children with ADHD displayed significant deficient emotional regulation.
