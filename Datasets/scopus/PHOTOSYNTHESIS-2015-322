Concentration of isoprene in artificial and thylakoid membranes




 
© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Isoprene emission protects plants from a variety of abiotic stresses. It has been hypothesized to do so by partitioning into cellular membranes, particularly the thylakoid membrane. At sufficiently high concentrations, this partitioning may alter the physical properties of membranes. As much as several per cent of carbon taken up in photosynthesis is re-emitted as isoprene but the concentration of isoprene in the thylakoid membrane of rapidly emitting plants has seldom been considered. In this study, the intramembrane concentration of isoprene in phosphatidylcholine liposomes equilibrated to a physiologically relevant gas phase concentration of 20 μL L−1 isoprene was less than predicted by ab initio calculations based on the octanol-water partitioning coefficient of isoprene while the concentration in thylakoid membranes was more. However, the concentration in both systems was roughly two orders of magnitude lower than previously assumed. High concentrations of isoprene (2000 μL L−1 gas phase) failed to alter the viscosity of phosphatidylcholine liposomes as measured with perylene, a molecular probe of membrane structure. These results strongly suggest that the physiological concentration of isoprene within the leaves of highly emitting plants is too low to affect the dynamics of thylakoid membrane acyl lipids. It is speculated that isoprene may bind to and modulate the dynamics of thylakoid embedded proteins.
