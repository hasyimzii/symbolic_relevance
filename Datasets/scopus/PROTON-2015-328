Highly Stable PEMFC Electrodes Based on Electrospun Antimony-Doped SnO2




 
Â© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. High durability and activity for the oxygen reduction reaction were demonstrated for oxide-supported platinum catalysts. The supports were antimony-doped SnO2 (ATO) fibres-in-tubes obtained by electrospinning and subsequent calcination. The doping with antimony instead of the already-reported niobium, allowed the preparation of tin oxide with electrical conductivity that was similar to carbon, which also had an increased electrocatalyst loading. Platinum nanoparticles supported on electrospun ATO demonstrated higher electrochemical stability and comparable mass activity to commercial Pt/C during exsitu potential cycling. The insitu fuel cell tests also revealed improved corrosion resistance with no noticeable degradation of the oxide-based membrane electrode assembly (MEA), but a slightly lower performance compared to the MEA with carbon-supported catalysts.
