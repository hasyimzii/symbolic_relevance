In this paper, the method of melting snow with carbon fibre heating wires buried in airport cement concrete pavement is presented to avoid the adverse effects of snow-melting chemicals. The snowmelting experiment of pavement is conducted when the snow is heavy and the air temperature is from -4 to -3°C. Electrical power is supplied to the pavement through the use of carbon fibre heating wires. It is shown that, with an input power of 300 W m-2, the temperature of pavement surface can achieve an increment of 7.48°C and the 2.5 cm thick snow can be melted within 4 hours, which is just for melting snow at this condition. The temperature and energy distribution along the depth of pavement is analysed at different times. The findings indicate that the method of melting snow on airport pavement with carbon fibre heating wires is feasible in the snowy weather condition.
