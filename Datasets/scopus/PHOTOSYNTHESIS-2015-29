Effect of diurnal irradiance on night chilling tolerance of six rubber cultivars




 
© 2016 The Institute of Experimental Botany The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is an important tropical crop with high economic value that has been successfully cultivated in Xishuangbanna prefecture, China. Xishuangbanna has a long dry season (November–February) with cold nights and frequent fog events. Thus, it is important to select chilling tolerant cultivars in order to understand better the role of fog in protecting rubber tree from chilling induced photodamage. In this study, we examined the photosynthetic responses of six rubber tree cultivars (Lan 873, Yunyan 77–2, Yunyan 77–4, GT1, Reken 523, and Reyan 733–97) to night chilling stress (0, 5, and 10°C) and two different irradiances (100 and 50% of full sunlight). Our results showed that all six cultivars could withstand nights at 10°C for three days, while night chilling at 0 and 5°C impaired photosynthesis, which was indicated by photoinhibition, decrease of soluble protein content, and accumulation of malondialdehyde. Reken 523 and Reyan 733–97 were more sensitive to night chilling than other cultivars. Low irradiance (50% of full sunlight) after chilling treatment apparently mitigated the effect of night chilling stress. It indicates that frequent fog events after cold nights might greatly contribute to the success of rubber tree cultivation in Xishuangbanna.
