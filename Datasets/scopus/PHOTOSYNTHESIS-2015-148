In studies on soy salt–alkali tolerance, since past few decades ago, the detailed mechanisms for salt–alkali tolerance regulation have not been clarified. In this study, soy 14-3-3 protein, SGF14c, was found as a new regulator that might be involved in the regulation of salt–alkali tolerance. SGF14c was highly expressed in salt–alkali-tolerant soy varieties and induced to express in salt–alkali susceptible soy varieties treated with 200 mM NaCl for 6, 12, and 24 h. The overexpression plasmid of SGF14c was constructed and transfected into salt–alkali susceptible soy varieties. The salt–alkali tolerance, photosynthesis, and Na+ were increased by the overexpression of SGF14c in transgenic soy. In conclusion, SGF14c is a new regulator involved in the regulation of salt–alkali tolerance in soy plants, and its up-regulation increases salt–alkali tolerance, photosynthesis, and Na+.
