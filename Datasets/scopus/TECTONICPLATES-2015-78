Mesozoic-cenozoic tectonic deformation units and styles in Lower Yangtze region




 
Â© 2015, Jilin University Press. All right reserved. Located in the eastern part of the Yangtze plate, the tectonic deformation of the Lower Yangtze is of geological significance. Based on the regional geological data, seismic data, well logging, and geophysical data, the stratigraphy and faults are finely interpreted, and two regional geological profiles are established throughout the study area, namely Suqian-Shaoxing profile and Lianyungang-Suzhou profile. The Lower Yangtze region is divided into 6 level one tectonic deformation units, followed by Subei-Jiaonan orogenic belt, Subei thrust area, north and south thrust belt, Sunan thrust area, Zhebei thrust area, and Jiangnan orogenic belt, and it can be further divided into 14 level two tectonic deformation units, which clearly represent the Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectonic deformation of the Lower Yangtze region. There are three typical tectonic deformation styles out of the two profiles, including compression, extension, inversion, which can be divided into 5 sub-classes and 10 small classes.
