The role of plastoglobules in thylakoid lipid remodeling during plant development




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Abstract Photosynthesis is the key bioenergetic process taking place in the chloroplast. The components of the photosynthetic machinery are embedded in a highly dynamic matrix, the thylakoid membrane. This membrane has the capacity to adapt during developmental transitions and under stress conditions. The galactolipids are the major polar lipid components of the thylakoid membrane conferring bilayer properties, while neutral thylakoid lipids such as the prenyllipids and carotenoids contribute to essential functions such as electron transport and photoprotection. Despite a large number of studies, the intriguing processes of thylakoid membrane biogenesis and dynamics remain unsolved. Plastoglobules, thylakoid-associated lipid droplets, appear to actively participate in thylakoid function from biogenesis to senescence. Recruitment of specific proteins enables the plastoglobules to act in metabolite synthesis, repair and disposal under changing environmental conditions and developmental stages. In this review, we describe plastoglobules as thylakoid membrane microdomains and discuss their involvement in lipid remodeling during stress and in the conversion from one plastid type to another.
