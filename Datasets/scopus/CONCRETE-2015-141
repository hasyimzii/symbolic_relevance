Analysis of serviceability limit state of GFRP prestressed concrete beams




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. In the recent years a vast of experimental work with non-metallic reinforcement is being widely used to explain a comprehensive structural integrity of composite material as an alternative for construction industry purposes. The objective of this research was to experimentally investigate serviceability limit state aspects related to flexural behavior of concrete beams internally prestressed with glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars. Such characteristics as the effect of prestressing force and reinforcement ratio on corresponding deflection as well as cracking distribution have been mainly governed by the stress-strain principles of reinforced concrete. The experimental results are compared to theoretical estimates from formulas available in U.S. and European codes and recommendations.
