Method of ensuring an interchangeability of the ultraviolet radiation sensors during a transition to its individual conversion function




 
Â© 2015 IEEE. This article show the results of the synthesis of the ultraviolet measurement system using photodiode. It was synthesized the generalized structure of the system and the scheme of its measurement channels. The measurement accuracy is increased by transition to individual conversion functions as a photodiode as well as measurement scheme. It is also proposed the scheme of data processing and evaluated the error of measurement of ultraviolet irradiation.
