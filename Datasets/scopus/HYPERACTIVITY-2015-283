Mismatched: ADHD symptomatology and the teacher–student relationship




 
© 2015 SEBDA. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and their teachers, and to examine whether this relationship was associated with children’s academic motivation. The sample comprised 35 children with clinically elevated levels of ADHD symptoms and 36 children with no ADHD symptoms between the ages of 6 and 10. Children with symptoms of ADHD and their teachers reported impairments in both the emotional and collaborative aspects of their relationships, particularly for girls in the ADHD group. For children in the ADHD group, a self-reported close bond in the teacher–student relationship was associated with increased academic motivation. These findings were significant after controlling for co-occurring behaviour problems and academic impairments. These findings suggest that the symptoms of ADHD may interfere with teacher–student relationship and may serve as a barrier in student’s academic achievement.
