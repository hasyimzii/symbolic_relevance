Proton exchange membranes based on sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) containing triazole group for enhanced proton conductivity




 
© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) (SPAEK) containing carboxylic acid groups at the pendant position was synthesized. The proton conductivity was enhanced over a wide range of humidity by grafting 1H-1,2,3-triazole (TRI), a heterocyclic protogenic reagent, on SPAEK via the pendant carboxylic acid. The proton conductivity, water uptake, and thermal and mechanical stability of the TRI-grafted SPAEK membranes (SPAEK-TRI) were measured and compared against those of a commercial Nafion® 117 membrane. The proton conductivity increased as the degree of sulfonation (DS) increased, and this effect was further enhanced by the introduction of TRI. The SPAEK-TRI membrane with 40% DS (SPAEK40-TRI) exhibited an even higher proton conductivity than Nafion® 117 over the entire range of relative humidity (RH). The SPAEK40-TRI membrane exhibited a tensile strength of 16.52. MPa, which was similar to that of Nafion® 117, and all of the membranes prepared in this study were thermally stable at up to 200. °C. The ion cluster dimensions for SPAEK40-TRI and SPAEK50-TRI were of 4.52. nm and 4.91. nm, respectively, which are larger than that of Nafion® 117, 3.36. nm. This difference is attributed to the higher water uptake in the SPAEK-TRI membranes than Nafion® 117.
