All rights reserved. {[Cu4(μ-bpe)4Cu2(μ-pydc)2(μ3-pydc)2]·14H2O}n (1) and [Cu(pydcH)2(bpe)2] (2) have been solvothermally synthesized by 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (bpe) along with dianionic pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylate (pydc) ligands and characterized by elemental, FT-IR and thermal analyses techniques. In the solvothermal synthesis of complexes, 1 was isolated when the reactor was opened whereas 2 was crystallized after 3 weeks. The X-ray crystallographic studies showthat complex 1 exhibits ladder-like structure involving mixed-valence Cu(I,II) which has generated a simultaneous in situ redox reaction and a unique 14-memberedwater cluster consisting of an eight-membered open-cube hexamer and two cyclic water trimers has been observed in hydrophilic cavities of 1. Supramolecularnetwork of 2, which has proton transfer product of pydcH cations, is formed by O-H⋯N and aromatic interactions.
