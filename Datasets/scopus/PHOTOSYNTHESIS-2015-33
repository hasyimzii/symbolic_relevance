© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht During September 21–26, 2015, an international conference entitled ‘‘Photosynthesis Research for Sustainability-2015’’ was held in honor of George C. Papageorgiou at the Conference Center of the Orthodox Academy of Crete, an exceptionally beautiful location right on the Mediterranean Sea coast, Kolymvari, Chania, Crete, (Greece) (see http://photosynthesis2015.cellreg.org/). The meeting was held under the auspices of the Greek “General Secretariat for Research and Technology” (GSRT). We first provide a brief introduction and key contributions of George C. Papageorgiou, the honored scientist, and then information on the conference, on the speakers, and the program. A special feature of this conference was awards given to 13 young investigators, who are recognized in this Report. Several photographs are also included; they show the pleasant ambience at this conference. We invite the readers to the next conference on “Photosynthesis Research for Sustainability-2016,” which will honor Nathan Nelson and T. Nejat Veziroglu; it will be held during June 19–25, 2016, in Pushchino, Moscow Region, Russia (see http://photosynthesis2016.cellreg.org/).
