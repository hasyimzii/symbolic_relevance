Critical review on eco-efficient ultra high performance concrete enhanced with nano-materials




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) is an innovative high-tech material, designed for the future. However, the high dosage of both Portland cement and silica fume, not only increases the cost of UHPC, but also represents a significant drawback regarding sustainability. This paper combines a critical review on UHPC mixture design methods with a discussion on the use of nano-materials in the latter aiming at reaching an eco-efficient UHPC. Based on a comprehensive bibliographic survey and a crossed analysis on both topics, conclusions are drawn towards sustainability of UHPC.
