Synthesis of α-Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Anilides via Copper-Catalyzed C-N Coupling of α-Hydroxyamides with Aryl Halides
			 




 
© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart . New York. The synthesis of highly important α-hydroxycarboxylic acid anilides via copper-catalyzed chemoselective C-N coupling reactions of α-hydroxyamides and aryl halides is described. This highly selective N-arylation process demonstrates wide substrate scope, cost savings and easy operation. In addition, the chirality of l-3-phenyllactamide is preserved during the reaction.
