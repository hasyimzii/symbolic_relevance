Chiral Pool-Based Synthesis of Naphtho-Fused Isocoumarins




 
© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. A variety of chiral derivatives of benzo[d]naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-6-one were prepared in a single step by Et3N-mediated condensation of homophthalic anhydride with different derivatives of (S)-amino acid chlorides at -5 °C by employing a chiral pool methodology.
