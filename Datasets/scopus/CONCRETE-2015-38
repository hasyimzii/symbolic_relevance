Structural performance of new fully and partially concrete-filled rectangular FRP-tube beams




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. This research introduces rectangular partially concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tube (CFFT) beams with inner voids and steel rebar. The beams contain an outer rectangular filament-wound FRP tube with an inner hollow circular or square FRP tube shifted toward the tension zone. The flexural behavior of the partially-CFFT beams was compared with a fully-CFFT beam, and another conventional steel-reinforced concrete (RC) beam having identical dimensions and flexural steel reinforcement. The results indicated that, the partially-CFFT beams had an overall strength-to-weight ratio 370% higher than that of the RC beam, while their weight was 30% lighter than the RC beam. In addition, the failure of the partially-CFFT beams was ductile in compression. The inner circular void indicated a slightly better performance than the square void in this partially-CFFT beam. Theoretical-section analysis has been conducted and compared with the experimental results.
