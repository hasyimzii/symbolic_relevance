Quaternary tectonic deformations and geomorphic setup of Samakhiali alluvial plain, Eastern Kachchh, Western India




 
© 2015, Geological Society of India. Eastern Kachchh is a critical intra-plate seismo-tectonic region where geomorphic features reflect pre-Quaternary and Quaternary structures and sub-surface-deformation. The Bhuj earthquake of 2001 occurred in the same region but did not generate any significant primary deformation features on the surface, however secondary deformations helped in deducing the nature of the earthquake. The present study was, therefore, aimed at understanding the nature of subsurface deformation applying geomorphic criteria in the alluvial landscape of Samakhiali plain. A wrench style of deformation has been observed in the sub-surface along the emerging tips of two faults–south Wagad fault and Kachchh Mainland fault. Incidentally the deformation model proposed here is substantiated by seismic studies carried out in this transition zone.
