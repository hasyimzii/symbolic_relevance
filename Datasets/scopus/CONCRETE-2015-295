A new type of concrete-filled square steel tubular column to steel-encased concrete composite beam connection was proposed, which was the part reinforcement-through with diaphragm-through connection. 3 specimens were designed and tested under low-cycle reversed loading. Based on the experimental studies, nonlinear finite element analysis was conducted using ANSYS. The failure mode, stress distribution, hysteretic curves and backbone curves obtained from the finite element analyses were in good agreement with the experimental results. Based on the finite element model, the parametric analyses of hysteretic behavior were conducted on the connections in which the plastic hinge is formed at the beam end. The influences of the floor thickness, the thickness of U-shape steel, the ratio of longitudinal reinforcement, the thickness of through diaphragm and the axial compression ratio on the hysteretic behavior were investigated. The results show that the floor thickness and the thickness of U-shape steel have a significant influence on the hysteretic behavior for the connection. The ratio of longitudinal reinforcement in the beam has some effects on the hysteretic behavior. The thicknesses of through diaphragm and the axial compression ratio have little influence on the hysteretic behavior.
