Properties and applications of foamed concrete; A review




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Foamed concrete possesses characteristics such as high strength-to-weight ratio and low density. Using foamed concrete reduces dead loads on the structure and foundation, contributes to energy conservation, and lowers the labor cost during construction. It also reduces the cost of production and transportation of building components compared to normal concrete and has the potential of being used as a structural material. This paper provides a review of foamed concrete constituents, fabrication techniques, and properties of foamed concrete. This literature review also aims to provide a comprehensive insight into possible applications of foamed concrete in the construction industry today.
