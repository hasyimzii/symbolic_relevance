Correlation of hydrogen bond through maximum eigen value analysis




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Investigation of hydrogen bond formation and its bond strength at different molar concentration ratios of co-solvent binary mixtures is aimed in the paper. Maximum eigen value technique is applied to explain the strength of hydrogen bond for various molar ratios. This method is based on the computation of statistical covariance's and eigen values made from FTIR spectral data. The formation of Hydrogen bond between the Ethanol (EtOH) and Propylene glycol (PG) at different molar ratios are analyzed in terms of intermolecular interactions present between the liquid systems through proton transfer. Molecular interactions involving various functional groups are studied using FTIR spectra and further the FTIR data are subjected to maximum Eigen analysis. The formation of hydrogen bond between Ethanol and PG is also confirmed from the DFT (B3LYP) calculations. Further discussion of hydrogen bond strength from Eigen analysis is correlated with the boiling point values which are obtained by experimental method at different molar concentration ratios of PG in ethanol. The hydrogen bond strength is stronger at (0.2 EtOH + 0.8 PG) molar ratio when compared to the other concentrations and it is supported with the Boiling point experiment method.
