Molecular mechanism of photosystem I assembly in oxygenic organisms




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Abstract Photosystem I, an integral membrane and multi-subunit complex, catalyzes the oxidation of plastocyanin and the reduction of ferredoxin by absorbed light energy. Photosystem I participates in photosynthetic acclimation processes by being involved in cyclic electron transfer and state transitions for sustaining efficient photosynthesis. The photosystem I complex is highly conserved from cyanobacteria to higher plants and contains the light-harvesting complex and the reaction center complex. The assembly of the photosystem I complex is highly complicated and involves the concerted assembly of multiple subunits and hundreds of cofactors. A suite of regulatory factors for the assembly of photosystem I subunits and cofactors have been identified that constitute an integrative network regulating PSI accumulation. This review aims to discuss recent findings in the field relating to how the photosystem I complex is assembled in oxygenic organisms.
