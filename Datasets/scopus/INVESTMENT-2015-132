Decision-specific experience and imitative behaviour in foreign ownership structure decisions: Evidence from large chinese firms




 
© China: An International Journal. Drawing on institutional theory, this article examines the importance of decision-specific experience and imitative behaviour of Chinese multinational corporations’ (MNCs) foreign ownership structure decisions. From a sample of 189 outward foreign direct investment (FDI) decisions, the authors find strong evidence to support the hypothesis that Chinese firms tend to choose ownership structures based on prior experience with similar ownership structures. Moreover, Chinese firms tend to follow the ownership structure patterns established by earlier Chinese entrants. This article also investigates the moderating effects of cultural distance and host country-specific experience.
