Recent advances on artificial intelligence and learning techniques in cognitive radio networks




 
Â© 2015, Abbas et al. Cognitive radios are expected to play a major role towards meeting the exploding traffic demand over wireless systems. A cognitive radio node senses the environment, analyzes the outdoor parameters, and then makes decisions for dynamic time-frequency-space resource allocation and management to improve the utilization of the radio spectrum. For efficient real-time process, the cognitive radio is usually combined with artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques so that an adaptive and intelligent allocation is achieved. This paper firstly presents the cognitive radio networks, resources, objectives, constraints, and challenges. Then, it introduces artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques and emphasizes the role of learning in cognitive radios. Then, a survey on the state-of-the-art of machine-learning techniques in cognitive radios is presented. The literature survey is organized based on different artificial intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, neural networks, game theory, reinforcement learning, support vector machine, case-based reasoning, entropy, Bayesian, Markov model, multi-agent systems, and artificial bee colony algorithm. This paper also discusses the cognitive radio implementation and the learning challenges foreseen in cognitive radio applications.
