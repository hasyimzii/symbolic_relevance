Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists in drug development




 
Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015. All right reserved. The first A2A adenosine receptor antagonist, istradefylline, was approved in 2013 in Japan for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). This will allow long-term studies to elucidate the neuroprotective potential of A2A antagonists in patients. New A2A antagonists are in clinical evaluation for PD. Additional promising indications for A2A antagonists are being explored, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disease (ADHD). A2A antagonists may be useful for the treatment of several rare neurodegenerative diseases, and their clinical evaluation for those diseases is warranted. Dual- and multi-target drugs combining A2A antagonism with A1 antagonism, MAO-B inhibition, dopamine receptor activation and/or NMDA receptor blockade may be advantageous for the treatment of PD and perhaps also for other brain diseases. X-ray structure of the human A2A adenosine receptor in complex with several antagonists and agonists provide a basis for understanding drug-receptor interactions and support the development of new drugs.
