The limited long-term hydrolytic stability of rapidly emerging 3D-extended framework materials (MOFs, COFs, MOPs, etc.) is still one of major barriers for their practical applications as new solid-state electrolytes in fuel cells. To obtain hydrolytically stable materials, two H2PO4 --exchanged 3D inorganic cationic extended frameworks (CEFs) were successfully prepared by a facile anion-exchange method. Both anion-exchanged CEFs (YbO(OH)P and NDTBP) show significantly enhanced proton conductivity when compared with the original materials (YbO(OH)Cl and NDTB) with an increase of up to four orders-of-magnitude, reaching 2.36×10-3 and 1.96×10-2 S cm-1 at 98 % RH and 85 °C for YbO(OH)P and NDTBP, respectively. These values are comparable to the most efficient proton-conducting MOFs. In addition, these two anion-exchanged materials are stable in boiling water, which originates from the strong electrostatic interaction between the H2PO4 - anion and the cationic host framework, showing a clear advance over all the acid-impregnated materials (H2SO4@MIL-101, H3PO4@MIL-101, and H3PO4@Tp-Azo) as practical solid-state fuel-cell electrolytes. This work offers a new general and efficient approach to functionalize 3D-extended frameworks through an anion-exchange process and achieves water-stability with ultra-high proton conductivity above 10-2 S cm-1.
