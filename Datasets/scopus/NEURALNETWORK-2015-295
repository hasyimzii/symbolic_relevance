Javascript malicious script detection algorithm based on multi-class features




 
Â© 2015, Science Press. All right reserved. Aiming at features of different levels in the script sample set, such as obfuscation, statistics and semantics, a malicious JavaScript script detection algorithm based on multi-class feature is proposed. The JavaScript analysis system, JavaScript codes analysis and detection, is implemented. The obfuscation features of the JavaScript are extracted and the obfuscated scripts are analyzed and deobfuscated by C4.5 algorithm. The static statistical features of the JavaScript are extracted, and according to the semantics, the JavaScript is serialized. Dangerous sequence tree is generated by the proposed algorithm to extract the dangerous sequence features of the malicious JavaScript. Three types of features are used as the input. The probabilistic neural network with strong ability to adapt to non-uniformity and the increasing quantity of the input samples is applied to construct the classifier for the detection of malicious JavaScript. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better detection accuracy and stability.
