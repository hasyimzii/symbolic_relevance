Attention deficit and attention training in early twentieth-century Japan




 
© 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien. Yuzero Motora (1856–1912), regarded as the first professional Japanese psychologist, tried to address students’ attention difficulties through attention training methods of his own design. His reports contain the first description of ADHD-like symptoms in the history of Japan. Motora viewed “distractibility” as the irregular transition of attention. Students with low scores and attention difficulties who participated in Motora’s exercises showed improvement in arithmetic, psychological testing, and certain aspects of daily life. This article describes Motora’s theoretical conception of attention and attention training methodology, the history of attention deficit and attention training, and the significance of Motora’s experiments.
