Corrosion products of carbonation induced corrosion in existing reinforced concrete facades




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Active corrosion in reinforced concrete structures is controlled by environmental conditions and material properties. These factors determine the corrosion rate and type of corrosion products which govern the total achieved service life. The type and critical amount of corrosion products were studied by electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry on concrete and reinforcement samples from existing concrete facades on visually damaged locations. The corrosion products in outdoor environment exposed concrete facades are mostly hydroxides (Feroxyhite, Goethite and Lepidocrocite) with a volume ratio to Fe of approximately 3. The results can be used to calibrate calculation of the critical corrosion penetration of concrete facade panels.
