Cytotoxic and antiviral tetramic acid derivatives from the deep-sea-derived fungus Trichobotrys effuse DFFSCS021




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Trichobotrysins A-F (1-6), a class of new tetramic acid derivatives with a decalin ring, were characterized from the culture of Trichobotrys effuse DFFSCS021 derived from the deep sea sediment collected from the South China Sea. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 1, 2, and 4 exhibited significant selective cytotoxicity against human carcinoma KG-1a cell line with IC50 values of 5.44, 8.97, and 6.16 μM, and obvious antiviral activity towards HSV-1 with IC50 values of 3.08, 9.37, and 3.12 μM, respectively. This is the first time to report the anti-HSV-1 activity of this type of compounds.
