Square-mean almost periodic solution for stochastic Hopfield neural networks with time-varying delays on timescales




 
Â© 2014, The Natural Computing Applications Forum. In this paper, we first propose a concept of square-mean almost periodic function on timescales. Then, by means of the fixed point theory and differential inequality techniques on timescales, we establish some sufficient conditions on the existence and global exponential stability of square-mean almost periodic solutions for a class of stochastic Hopfield neural networks with time-varying delays on timescales. Our results are new even if the timescale T = R or Z. Finally, we present an example to illustrate our theoretical results.
