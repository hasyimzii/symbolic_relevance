Cascade Feed Forward Neural Network-based Model for Air Pollutants Evaluation of Single Monitoring Stations in Urban Areas




 
Â© 2016 by Giacomo Capizzi. In this paper, air pollutants concentrations for NO2, NO, NOx and PM10 in a single monitoring station are predicted using the data coming from other different monitoring stations located nearby. A cascade feed forward neural network based modeling is proposed. The main aim is to provide a methodology leading to the introduction of virtual monitoring station points consistent with the actual stations located in the city of Catania in Italy.
