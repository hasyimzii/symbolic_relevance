The effects of the phenol concentrations on photosynthetic parameters of Salix babylonica L.




 
© 2015, The Institute of Experimental Botany. As a common waterfront and wet environment tree species, Salix babylonica shows a great potential for restoration of contaminated water or soil environments, such as phenol-polluted water. However, studies on such remediation effects have not been carried out yet. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of phenols on photosynthesis of S. babylonica. Photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of S. babylonica cuttings were determined in hydroponic experiment, where six phenol concentrations was used (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg L−1). Phenol presence inhibited photosynthesis of S. babylonica significantly, as the net photosynthetic rate (PN), light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, apparent quantum yield, maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry, and effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry declined significantly. The higher the concentration of phenol solution, the greater inhibition of photosynthesis occurred. Our data indicated that nonstomatal limitation was responsible for the reduction of PN. S. babylonica should be used to remediate phenol-contaminated water, when the concentration of phenol solution is lower than 200 mg L−1. Otherwise, the efficiency of photosynthesis of S. babylonica would decrease markedly. However, further study is needed to determine the maximum concentration of phenol that S. babylonica can tolerate to maintain normal photosynthetic activity.
