Expedient synthesis of gem-dialkylbenzyl heterocycles through olefinic hydroarylation




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. A robust approach to gem-dialkylbenzyl heterocycles has been developed through a triflic acid-catalyzed hydroarylation of olefinic heterocycles. A broad range of substrates containing pyridine, quinoline, pyrazole, triazole and imidazole moieties are shown to be highly compatible with this method. This rapid construction of gem-dialkyl groups should be useful in the synthesis of drug-like molecules containing heterocyclic diversity and in the study of the gem-dialkyl effect.
