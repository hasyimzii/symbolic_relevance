Artificial immune system for Android OS




 
Â© 2015 IEEE. The paper presents and discusses a method of creating a security system for Android operating system. Based on the application of an Artificial Immune System and neural networks we construct the 'antivirus' system especially for Android system that can detect and block undesirable and malicious applications. This system can be characterized by self-adaption and self-evolution and can detect even unknown and previously unseen malicious applications.
