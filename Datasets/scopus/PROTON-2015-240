New diterpenoids from Sapium discolor




 
Â© 2015 Taylor and Francis. Chemical fractionation of the ethanolic extract generated from the twigs and leaves of Sapium discolor led to the isolation and identification of four new macrocyclic diterpenoids including three members of the rare casbane family, sapidisins A-C (1-3), and an analog of the cembrane class, sapidisin D (4), a new 3,4-seco ent-kaurane diterpenoid (5), and 18 known phenolic compounds. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses especially 1D NMR 1H-1H couplings and 2D NMR ROESY data. The discovery of 1-4 from S. discolor provides a clue for further study on the biogenetic evolution of the widely existent tigliane-type diterpenoids in the Sapium species.
