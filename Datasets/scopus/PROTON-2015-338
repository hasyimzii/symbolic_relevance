Structure-activity relationship studies on rhodamine B-based fluorogenic probes and their activation by anticancer platinum(II) compounds




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc. Fluorescence microscopy has emerged as an attractive technique for imaging intracellular Pt species arising from exposure to clinical anticancer drugs such as cisplatin. A rhodamine-B based fluorogenic probe termed Rho-DDTC can be activated selectively in the presence of Pt(II) compounds, and possesses the ability to discriminate Pt(II) species from Pt(IV) carboxylate prodrug complexes, thereby providing a unique platform to investigate the reduction of these Pt(IV) complexes after cell entry. In this report, we seek to establish the mechanism of activation of Rho-DDTC through a structure-activity relationship study on its structural analogues.
