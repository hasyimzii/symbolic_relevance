Bifurcation Behavior for an Electronic Neural Network Model with Two Different Delays




 
Â© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York. In this paper, an electronic neural network model with two different delays is investigated. The conditions for the local stability and the existence of Hopf bifurcation at the equilibrium of the system are derived. By applying the normal form theory and center manifold theory, some explicit formulae for determining the stability and the direction of the Hopf bifurcation periodic solutions are obtained. Numerical simulations for justifying the theoretical analysis are also included. Finally, main conclusions are given.
