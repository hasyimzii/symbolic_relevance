Acceleration response, seismic residual deformation and dynamic failure of dam in earthquake are the important contents of dam dynamic analysis. Two Houziyan high concrete face rock-fill dam models (2-D and 3-D) which are 1.0 meter high were designed and constructed considering the valley topographic of dam site and dam's structure features. Firstly, the acceleration response characteristics of dam was studied deeply; then, the seismic residual deformation process and the dynamic failure mechanism of dam were analyzed comprehensively. The study shows that, the acceleration response amplitude of dam was reduced because of the impacts of concrete face slab, and the amplification effects of dam to bedrock inputting earthquake on left and right river bank was different obviously; seismic residual deformation of the concrete face rock-fill dam is relatively lower, and the anti-seismic performance of dam is well; the downstream kentledge platform of dam that switch station of the water power station was constructed on it is the weakness of dam system in earthquake, and the specific anti-seismic design for it is necessary.
