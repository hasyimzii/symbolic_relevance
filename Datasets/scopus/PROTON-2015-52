In the present work, the in-plane structuration of the electrode Gas Diffusion Layer (GDL) is proposed as an interesting approach to reduce the operating heterogeneities occurring within the cell along the gas flow fields, especially in dry operating conditions. This is especially important for transportation applications where the fuel cell is often operated in these conditions. Structured and homogeneous large-area (220 cm2) membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are tested in single-cell and 6-cell stack configurations. An S++® electronic card inserted in the stack is used to measure the current distribution within the cell, which is an indicator of the local electrochemical reaction conditions. The results of the current distribution measurements together with the cell performances obtained for the structured and the homogenous MEAs indicate that the electrode in-plane structuration is effective in reducing the functioning heterogeneities within the cell under specific operating conditions.
