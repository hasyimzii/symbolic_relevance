Influence of specimen size on autogenous volume deformation of concrete with magnesium oxide




 
In order to investigate the influence of specimen size on autogenous volume deformation of concrete with magnesium oxide (MgO), the role of autogenous volume deformation of MgO concrete was tested. The results show that the specimen size has an obvious influence on autogenous volume deformation of MgO concrete.
