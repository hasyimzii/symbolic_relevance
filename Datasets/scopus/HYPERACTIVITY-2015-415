The comorbidity between bipolar disorder and ADHD in a young adult: a focus on impulsivity




 
Impulsivity is a complex behavioural feature of many psychiatric disorders, in particular of risk-taking behaviour, and is an important determinant of personality. Both ADHD and bipolar disorder express features of impulsivity. The concept of having two or more simultaneous psychiatric conditions is an increasingly recognised concept in the field of psychiatry, and is important clinically for management and prognosis. Consequently, the aim of this case presentation is to report about a young patient with both bipolar II and ADHD, in order to better understand which of the possible clinical phenotypes of these psychiatric conditions exist in comorbidity, mainly focusing on impulsive features because of the relevant challenge that this psychological aspect can represent in the clinical treatment of these patients.
