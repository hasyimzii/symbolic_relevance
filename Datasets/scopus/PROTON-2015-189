Pd-catalyzed decarboxylative coupling of arylalkynyl carboxylic acids with allyl ethers: Regioselective synthesis of branched 1,3-enynes




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. This work reported an efficient and novel method to prepare branched 1,3-enynes via Pd(II)-catalyzed decarboxylative coupling of arylalkynyl carboxylic acids with allylic ethers under mild conditions. Various arylalkynyl carboxylic acids and allylic ethers could participate in the reaction, regioselectively affording the desired branched 1,3-enynes in moderate to good yields.
