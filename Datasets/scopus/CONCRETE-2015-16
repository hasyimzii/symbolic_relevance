Strength, chloride resistance, and expansion of concretes containing ground bagasse ash




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. This research examines the strength and durability properties of concrete containing up to 50% ground bagasse ash (GBA) replacing ordinary Portland cement (OPC) by weight of binder. The setting times, compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, chloride resistance, and expansion due to a 5% Na2SO4 solution of concretes containing ground bagasse ash were investigated. The results showed that concrete with 50% of GBA produced at least 90% compressive strength as compared to control concrete (CT concrete) at the age of 28 days. The rapid chloride ion penetration in term of charge passed (Coulombs) was at a very low level when 20-50% of GBA was used to replace OPC in the concrete. Moreover, the same trend of chloride penetration depth was found by the immersion test, i.e., the chloride resistance increased with the increase of GBA replacement. The results suggest that the use of GBA of up to 50% to replace OPC by weight of binder can increase the durability properties of concrete, especially its chloride penetration resistance.
