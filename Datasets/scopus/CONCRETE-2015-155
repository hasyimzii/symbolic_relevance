Harsh environments effects on the axial behaviour of circular concrete-filled fibre reinforced-polymer (FRP) tubes




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Concrete-filled fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) tubes (CFFTs) are becoming an attractive system for structural elements proposed to harsh environments. FRP tube provides a corrosion resistant element, reinforcement, confinement for the concrete core, and a stay-in-place formwork. Harsh environments may affect the mechanical performance of the FRP tube, which consequently affect the structural response of the CFFT members. This project investigates the environmental degradation and the durability of concrete cylinders unconfined and confined by filament-wound glass-FRP tubes. Standard plain concrete cylinders and CFFT cylinders were immersed in pure water, salt and alkaline solutions, and exposed to 200 freeze-thaw cycles, between -40°C and +40°C. Then, the cylinders were tested under uniaxial compression test to evaluate their performance by comparing the stress-strain behaviour and their ultimate load capacities. Test results indicated that the FRP tube, in CFFTs, is significantly qualified as a sustainable coating material to resist the harsh environments attacks. Theoretical predictions using long term confinement models from CSA and ACI codes are presented.
