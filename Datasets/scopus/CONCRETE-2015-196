Analysis of influence of additional load caused by prestressed reinforcement destruction of CRTS I track slab




 
Â© 2015, Science Press. All right reserved. To deal with prestressed reinforcement destruction in CRTS I track slabs during high-speed railway operation, in this paper, the analysis model on CRTS I track slab and its prestressed reinforcement was built, to calculate and analyze the additional load of track slab caused by destruction of longitudinal and transverse prestressed reinforcement in different locations and different numbers. The calculation results showed that longitudinal prestressed reinforcement loss will bring additional bending moment to the track slab, which will lead to track warpage. Prestressed reinforcement loss posed less impact on the longitudinal and transverse stress peak value, while the overall preload force decreased with the increase of the number of ruptured prestressed tendons, with more obvious preload losses occuring in the slab end. The preload loss in the center of the slab was less than the slab end due to the interlayer adhesion constraints. The calculation result of prestressed reinforcement stress showed that the prestressed reinforcement force was substantially independent of the damage of the adjacent prestressed reinforcement damage.
