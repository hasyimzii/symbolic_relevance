Taking specimen aggregate area and interface perimeter relation as the index for representing concrete mesostructure, specimen mesostructure changing law is studied with numerical method by quantifying the index with fractal methods. Then the effect of mesostructure changing on specimen mechanical property and the mechanism are also further studied. Through the research, following results are obtained:(1) the change of aggregate volume fraction affects the mesostructure little, while the change of specimen size has a lot of influence on the mesostructure;(2) the change of specimen size affects its mechanical property a lot, while the change of aggregate volume fraction barely affects it: that is the contribution of aggregate volume fraction increase on specimen bearing capacity increase and global stress level decrease would be more obviously with larger size;(3) the increase of aggregate volume fraction would not only increase local cracking stress, but also decrease the cracking strain, resulting in larger cracking brittleness, thus the cracking localization feature would be more obviously in larger aggregate volume fraction situation.
