State-of-the-art literature review on concrete meso-scale mechanics




 
Â© All right reserved. As a typical multiphase heterogeneous material, concrete has been widely used in high-rise buildings, bridges, dams, nuclear power stations as well as other industrial and civil structures. The whole process of concrete production, transportation, construction, curing and hardening, and its nonlinearmechanical and deformation response subjected to complex loading environments are generally dominated by the physico-mechanical properties of meso-scale ingredients and fabrics, including aggregates, mortar and their interfaces. This paper presents a literature review on the state-of-the-art concrete meso-scale mechanics, emphasizing the development progress on experimental investigation on meso-scale ingredients, pre-processing modeling approaches, and numerical modeling methodsfor concrete. An in-depth review is also presented on selected aspects on the forefront of the meso-scale concrete mechanics, including the fracture failure mechanism, size effect, multi-scale coupling and rate effect. Finally, some recommendations for future studies are provided.
