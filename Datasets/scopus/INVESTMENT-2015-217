Chinese MNEs and managerial knowledge transfer in Africa: the case of the construction sector in Ghana




 
© 2015 The Chinese Economic Association – UK This paper considers the case of managerial knowledge spillovers from Chinese FDI in Africa, in the context of the Ghanaian construction sector. Using empirical data from in-depth qualitative interviews, the paper first identifies key channels and determinants of managerial knowledge spillovers. Limited local employment at the managerial level in Chinese construction firms is the main impediment to managerial knowledge spillovers from these firms. Cultural and linguistic barriers can explain this situation. Localisation strategies, defined as the progressive replacement of Chinese managers by local ones, can help overcome these barriers and foster managerial knowledge spillovers.
