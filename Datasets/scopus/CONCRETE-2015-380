Experiments and simulations of rheological and flow characteristics of flowable concrete using particle method




 
Â© 2015 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. In the study, rheological and L-box flow characteristics were evaluated by experiments varying with the water to cement ratio and superplasticising contents. Moreover, the measured rheological parameters were applied into a viscoplastic particle method as viscoplastic constitutive parameters in order to simulate the flow behaviour of flowable concrete. The viscoplastic particle model has been formulated based on the Navier-Stokes equation in Lagrangian form and on the conservation of mass. In comparison of L-box flow test, the current particle model could well estimate the measured flow responses varying with water to cement ratios and superplasticising contents.
