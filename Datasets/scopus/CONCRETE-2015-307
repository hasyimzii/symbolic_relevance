Effect of partial utilisation of lime mud waste on strength of concrete
	 




 
In this paper, the large scale utilisation of lime mud in construction industry particularly in concrete works has been explored. Experimental investigations were carried out to evaluate the strength properties of Lime mud blended cement concrete. The nominal mixes of concrete M-15 and M-20 grade were considered and produced by replacing cement partially with lime mud. Cement in concrete was replaced with 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% with lime mud and a set of cubes were cast. The compression tests were carried out to evaluate the strength properties. Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity tests were carried out at 7 days and 28 days. Test results indicated that ordinary concrete can be produced by replacing cement with lime mud.
