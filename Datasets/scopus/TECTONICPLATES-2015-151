Influence of plate tectonic mode on the coupled thermochemical evolution of Earth's mantle and core




 
Â© 2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. We investigate the influence of tectonic mode on the thermochemical evolution of simulated mantle convection coupled to a parameterized core cooling model. The tectonic mode is controlled by varying the friction coefficient for brittle behavior, producing the three tectonic modes: mobile lid (plate tectonics), stagnant lid, and episodic lid. The resulting compositional structure of the deep mantle is strongly dependent on tectonic mode, with episodic lid resulting in a thick layer of subducted basalt in the deep mantle, whereas mobile lid produces only isolated piles and stagnant lid no basaltic layering. The tectonic mode is established early on, with subduction initiating at around 60 Myr from the initial state in mobile and episodic cases, triggered by the arrival of plumes at the base of the lithosphere. Crustal production assists subduction initiation, increasing the critical friction coefficient. The tectonic mode has a strong effect on core evolution via its influence on deep mantle structure; episodic cases in which a thick layer of basalt builds up experience less core heat flow and cooling and a failed geodynamo. Thus, a continuous mobile-lid mode existing from early times matches Earth's mantle structure and core evolution better than an episodic mode characterized by large-scale flushing (overturn) events.
