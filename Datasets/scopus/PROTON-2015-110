Carbohydrate-based furopyran-3-ones: Synthesis via a rare carbonyl nucleophilic 1,2-migration induced by TMSOTf and antifungal activity




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. A versatile method for synthesis of chiral furopyran-β-one analogues starting from 1,4:3,6-dianhydrofructose has been developed. The target compounds were acquired by treatment of 1,4:3,6-dianhydrofructose with benzaldehydes in the presence of KF/Al2O3 and subsequent ring expansion of furanones induced by TMSOTf (trimethylsilyl triflate). The ring expansion involves an unprecedented nucleophilic 1,2-migration of a keto-carbonyl as a key step. In vitro antifungal activity of all compounds obtained were evaluated against five human pathogenic fungi (Candida parapsilosis ATCC22019, Candida albicans ATCC10231, Trichophyton rubrum CMCC(F)T1f, Epidermophyton floccosum CMCC(F)E1d, and Microsporum canis CMCC(F)M3d). We found that the furopyran-β-one analogues bearing chloro or fluoro group showed significant inhibitory activity against dermatophytes, especially M. canis.
