Photosynthetic characteristics and effects of exogenous glycine of Chorispora bungeana under drought stress




 
Â© 2016 The Institute of Experimental Botany We investigated photosynthetic characteristics of Chorispora bungeana under conditions of drought stress caused by different concentrations of polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG; 0, 5, 20, and 40%) and various concentrations of exogenous glycine (0, 5, 10, and 20 mM) with 20% PEG. We showed that moderate and severe drought stress of PEG reduced chlorophyll (Chl) content (both Chl a and b), maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), and quantum yield of regulated energy dissipation (YNPQ), but Chl a/b and quantum yield of non-regulated energy dissipation (YNO) increased. The low and moderate drought stress increased Mg2+ and Fe3+ contents, while a decrease of Mg2+ and Fe3+ were found under severe drought. Compared to sole PEG stress, the addition of exogenous 10 mM glycine increased Chl, Mg2+ and Fe3+ contents, Fv/Fm, actual quantum yield of PSII photochemistry, and YNPQ, and reduced YNO. On the contrary, 20 mM glycine showed an opposite effect, except for YNO. Our results proved that Chl contents and fluorescence parameters are reliable indicators for drought tolerance of Chorispora bungeana. We suggest that a proper glycine content can relieve the effect of drought stress on Chorispora bungeana.
