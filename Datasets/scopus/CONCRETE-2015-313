Failure design of high-rise concrete panels under fire loading




 
Â© Publishing: All rights reserved. The present contribution addresses the crucial issue of predicting the failure of high-rise reinforced concrete walls subjected to fire loading conditions. A three-step procedure is proposed, in which the yield design (limit analysis) method is applied on two separate levels. First, as a way for assessing the local strength properties of the wall, modelled as a plate, as a function of temperature gradient across the wall thickness. Second, for analysing the overall stability of the wall in its fire-induced deformed configuration on account of the previously determined strength properties. A comprehensive numerical approach is set up, based on plate finite-element yield design computations associated with non-linear optimisation schemes, and a first illustrative application is performed leading to first conclusive results regarding structural fire safety.
