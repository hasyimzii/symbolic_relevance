Use of treated domestic effluent as mixing water for concrete: Effect on strength and water penetration at 28 days




 
The study tests the feasibility of utilizing treated domestic effluent as mixing water for ordinary concrete. The treated wastewater used for the investigation was collected from a typical sewage treatment plant in New Delhi (India). Collected samples were chemically characterized to check conformance with the recommendations of relevant standards for use in concrete production. The 28 days compressive strength, pH, degree of hydration, surface hardness, cover strength and water penetration characteristics of concrete produced using wastewater were tested at par with the relevant standards and were found to be similar or better than those measured for the control concrete mixed using tap water.
