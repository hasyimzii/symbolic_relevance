Effects of methylphenidate during emotional processing in amphetamine users: preliminary findings




 
© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. D-amphetamine (dAMPH) and methylphenidate (MPH) are stimulants used in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Preclinical studies have shown that in healthy animals, dAMPH induces dopamine (DA) dysfunction, as evidenced for instance by loss of DA levels and its transporters. It has also been suggested that DA plays an important role in emotional processing, and that altered DA-ergic intervention may modulate amygdala function. To explore the role of the DA system in emotional processing we examined emotional processing using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in eight male recreational users of dAMPH and eight male healthy controls. We compared brain activation between both groups during an emotional face-processing task with and without an oral MPH challenge. All subjects were abstinent for at least 2 weeks during the baseline scan. The second scan was performed on the same day 1½ hours after receiving an oral dose of 35 mg MPH. A significant Valence*Group interaction (p =.037) indicated amygdala hyperreactivity to fearful facial expressions in dAMPH users that wasrobust against adjustment for age (p =.015). Furthermore, duration of amphetamine use in years was positively correlated with amygdala reactivity in dAMPH users (r =.76; p =.029). These exploratory findings are in line with previous findings suggesting that DA plays a role in emotional processing.
