Water-insoluble sericin/β-cyclodextrin/PVA composite electrospun nanofibers as effective adsorbents towards methylene blue




 
© 2015 Elsevier B.V. A novel water-insoluble sericin/β-cyclodextrin/poly (vinyl alcohol) composite nanofiber adsorbent was prepared by electrospinning and followed by thermal crosslinking for removal of cationic dye methylene blue from aqueous solution. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solubility experiments confirmed that sericin and β-cyclodextrin were incorporated into the nanofibers and the crosslinking reaction occurred successfully. Kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics analysis were studied for adsorption of methylene blue. The adsorption process is better fitted with the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacities are 187.97, 229.89, and 261.10. mg/g at the temperatures 293, 313 and 333. K, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters showed that methylene blue adsorption was endothermic and spontaneous. In addition, the fiber membrane adsorbent could be easily separated from dye solution and showed high recyclable removal efficiency. All these results suggest that crosslinked sericin/β-cyclodextrin/poly(vinyl alcohol) composite nanofibers could be potential recyclable adsorbents in dye wastewater treatment.
