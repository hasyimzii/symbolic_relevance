Electrical method to evaluate elastic modulus of early age concrete




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. In this study, the relationship between the modulus of elasticity and the resistivity of concrete was investigated. The resistivity of concrete was measured by newly developed non-contact electrical method and the modulus of elasticity of concrete was measured by echo flying time method. The study focuses on the early age concrete. It is found that there was a non-linear relationship exists between the modulus of elasticity and resistivity of concrete. It is possible to use the resistivity values to predict the modulus of elasticity for concrete, especially in early stage.
