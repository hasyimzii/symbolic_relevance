Cytotoxic tigliane-type diterpenoids from Croton tiglium




 
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Chemical study on the twigs and leaves of Croton tiglium has led to the isolation of 11 new tigliane-type diterpenoids, crotignoids A-K (1-11), along with eight known analogues (12-19). The structures of these compounds were elucidated on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis. In vitro cytotoxic assays revealed moderate inhibition of compounds 1-10 toward human HL-60 and A549 tumor cells, with 1 exhibiting the strongest activity against HL-60 cell line with an IC50 value of 1.61 μM.
