Palladium-Catalyzed Intramolecular Aminotrifluoromethoxylation of Alkenes




 
Â© 2015 American Chemical Society. The first catalytic trifluoromethoxylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed, in which Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 was used as catalyst, AgOCF3 as trifluoromethoxide source, and Selectfluor-BF4 as oxidant. A variety of 3-OCF3 substituted piperidines were selectively obtained in good yields. Direct evidence was provided to address the facile reductive elimination of PdIV-OCF3 complex to form sp3 C-OCF3 bond.
