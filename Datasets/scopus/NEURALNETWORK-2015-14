Global exponential stability of general A-monotone implicit fuzzy proximal dynamical systems in Banach spaces




 
© 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of general A-monotone operators in Banach spaces. Under some suitable conditions and using generalized proximal mapping technique, neural network technique and Gronwall’s inequality, a new class of general A-monotone implicit fuzzy proximal dynamical systems in Banach spaces are also proposed and analyzed through a recurrent neural network with a one-layer structure, and the existence of the solutions of the proximal dynamical systems is shown. Further, the global exponential stability of these dynamical systems is proved. The results presented in this paper improve and generalize the corresponding results in the literature.
