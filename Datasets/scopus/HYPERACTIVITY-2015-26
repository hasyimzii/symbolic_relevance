Profiles of problem and non-problem gamblers, depending on their preferred gambling activity




 
© 2015 Taylor & Francis Background and aims: The objective was to compare the gamblers’ profiles and practices depending on their preferred gambling activity, especially for two structural characteristics: presence of skill and expected value linked to the game. Another objective was to compare the profiles between non-problem and problem gamblers, and especially to identify how they evolve once problem gambling has emerged. Methods: Six hundred twenty-eight non-problem and problem gamblers were assessed with a structured interview, including sociodemographic characteristics, gambling habits, DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling, gambling-related cognitions, personality profile, psychiatric comorbidities and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. We used a stepwise logistic regression with backward elimination to compare gamblers’ profiles depending on: (1) the presence of skill in their favourite game, (2) the expected value of their favourite game. Each regression was performed twice, in non-problem and then in problem gamblers. Results: Contrary to what was expected, the gamblers’ profiles did not differ in gambling-related cognitions according to their chosen game, even at a problematic level of gambling. Problem gamblers of bank games of pure chance showed high levels of persistence and higher frequencies of suicidal risk, problem gamblers of bank games with an element on skill displayed more illegal acts, and gamblers of social games lost their cooperativeness profile on reaching a problematic level of gambling. Conclusions: Significant differences in the profiles of gamblers were identified based on their preferred gambling activity, especially in problem gamblers. Specific therapeutic and protective approaches which could be developed for these different profiles are proposed.
