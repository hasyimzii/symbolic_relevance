Long-term chloride profiles in bridge decks treated with penetrating sealer or corrosion inhibitors




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. The long-term influence of three corrosion-inhibiting admixtures and a penetrating sealer on deck chloride profiles were examined on nine different bridges in Wisconsin. Chloride analyses were performed after 12-16 years of field exposure to a deicing salt environment. Two of the bridge decks were sealed with a tri-siloxane penetrating sealer at the end of construction without any subsequent reapplication; two were periodically sealed (using the same tri-siloxane product) beginning 4 years after construction; two decks utilized corrosion inhibiting admixtures and included untreated control segments; and three decks were completely untreated. Results from the field chloride evaluations indicated that bridge decks treated with the surface-applied penetrating sealer performed comparatively better when such treatments were repeated over time. When the sealer is used early and reapplied periodically, the primary effect is to reduce the effective surface chloride concentration. Two corrosion inhibiting admixtures performed better than their corresponding control sections of the bridge deck. Corrosion inhibiting admixtures resulted in a reduced apparent diffusion coefficient compared to their respective controls. The relative reduction in the diffusion coefficient was larger when the concrete itself had a higher diffusion coefficient.
