The expansive characteristics of UEA (calcium sulphoaluminate expansive agent) and HCSA (calcium sulphoaluminate-calcium oxide expansive agent) were studied, and then the expansive agent suitable for shrinkage-compensating concrete was determined. The influences of internal curing on compressive strength, early deformation, drying shrinkage drop and crack resistance of shrinkage-compensating concrete were investigated in laboratory, and subsequent field application was carried out in northwest high wind arid area. It is indicated from the result that HCSA with higher expansion and less dependence on external water curing at later stage can meet the shrinkage-compensating requirement of concrete as long as its use level (by mass) reaches up to 6%; with internal curing, the effectiveness of HCSA could be improved, and the plastic shrinkage and drying shrinkage drop of shrinkage-compensating concrete could be reduced, and the crack resistance of shrinkage-compensating concrete could be improved; the internal curing shrinkage-compensating concrete applied in thin-plate structure with vast exposed surface in northwest high wind arid area exhibits good crack resistance.
