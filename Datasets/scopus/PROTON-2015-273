Extraction chromatographic behavior of actinium and REE on DGA, Ln and TRU resins in nitric acid solutions




 
© 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary. The extraction-chromatographic behavior of actinium, rare earth elements and other radionuclides formed upon the irradiation of thorium by medium energy protons was studied. The k′ values for Ac(III), Ce(III) and La(III) in nitric acid solutions using Ln Resin, DGA Resin and TRU Resin (Triskem Int.) were determined. The optimal conditions for separation of Ac(III) and rare earth elements (REE(III)) were defined. The obtained results can be used to develop the multipurpose analytical procedure for actinium separation either for the needs of nuclear medicine or for radiochemical analysis of environmental samples.
