Proton/metal-ligand stability constants of complexes of Ni(II), Cu(II), and Co(II) with diethyl 4-(substituted-phenyl)-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate in 70% dioxane-water mixture




 
Â© 2015 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. Physico-chemical properties viz proton-ligand and metal-ligand stability constants of complexes of diethyl 4-(substituted-phenyl)-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate with Ni(II), Cu(II), and Co(II) were determined in mixed solvents (70% dioxane). Presence of OH/NH group(s) in these compounds was confirmed at 0.1 M ionic strength in 70% dioxane-water mixture pH-metrically. It is observed that Ni(II), Cu(II), and Co(II) metal ions formed 1: 1 and 1: 2 complex with all the three ligands. The results show that the ratio of logK 1/logK 2 is positive in all cases. This implies that there is little or no steric hindrance to the addition of secondary molecules.
