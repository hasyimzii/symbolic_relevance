To study box type concrete beams strengthened with steel plate on flexural properties and influencing factors, eight box type concrete beams are designed with different concrete strength, reinforcement ratio, amount of reinforcement steel plate and U-shaped hoop spacing, corresponding bending tests are carried out. Results show that the flexural performance of the beams can be well improved by steel plate strengthened. The destruction phenomenon of unreinforced box type concrete beams manifests as over bar, reinforced concrete compression zone is crushed, tensile reinforcement and steel plate are yield, and debonding failure phenomenon does not occur between steel plate and concrete. The yield load is significantly improved by steel plate strengthened by 45%~143%, and ultimate load of beams improved by 74%~183%. Steel plate strengthened is a passive strengthened, which has little effect on the crack load, the stiffness of strengthened beams can be significantly improved by strengthened with steel plate. The stiffness, yield load and ultimate load of box type concrete beam are increased with the increase of concrete strength, reinforcement ratio, reinforcement ratio and U-hoop spacing. The strain of steel plate grows rapidly and strain of reinforcement is limited after reinforcement yielding. The strengthened material is useful so the steel plate strengthening may achieve good effects.
