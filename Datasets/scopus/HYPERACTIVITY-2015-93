Objective: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with an estimated prevalence of 5% and its increased risk for comorbidities is of significant relevance for the health care system and is as well of socio-political significance. There is a lack of established methods for the evaluation of the diagnostic and therapeutic treatment of the patients. In this study, we have developed a set of evidence- and consensus-based meaningful indicators for the treatment of children with ADHD. Methods: Following a thorough examination of the literature and published Guidelines, a first set of 90 quality indicators was created after redundancy reduction and addition of newly developed indicators. The further development of the indicator set was based on a modified version of the 2-step RAND/UCLA expert evaluation method. Results: After assessment in 2 rounds of ratings, a set of 39 homogeneously positively rated indicators was established. 28 indicators apply to the quality of the diagnostic and therapeutic process, 4 to structural conditions and 3 rely on outcome. Conclusion: This is the first study covering the aspect of quality measurement in children with developmental disorders, especially ADHD. For the next step a pilot evaluation is necessary to complete the evaluation of the quality indicators.
