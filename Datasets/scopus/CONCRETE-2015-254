In this study, the effect of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber on the behavior of concrete under freeze-thaw condition is investigated. Experimental investigations are conduct to measure the workability, compressive strength, bending strength, total charge passed and frost resistance of PVA fiber concrete in fresh water and NaCl solution under freezing and thawing cycles. The relative dynamic modulus of elasticity and the relative mass change of specimens at each cycle are measured. In addition, the surface deterioration of concrete specimens is also observed. Specimens with different volume content of fiber are tested in order to find the optimization PVA fiber content for frost resistance. Six series of specimens with PVA fiber volume content of 0%, 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1.0% are tested. Finally, a model considering internal crack healing and cracking property of fiber concrete is proposed in this study. It is shown that the proposed model is able to predict the test results with reasonable accuracy.
