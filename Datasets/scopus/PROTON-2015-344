Bifunctional (Thio)urea-Phosphine Organocatalysts Derived from d -Glucose and α-Amino Acids and Their Application to the Enantioselective Morita-Baylis-Hillman Reaction




 
© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart · New York. Novel (thio)urea-tertiary phosphines were developed for use as bifunctional organocatalysts readily available from naturally occurring molecules: saccharides and amino acids. The efficiency of the organocatalysts was demonstrated in the asymmetric Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reaction of aromatic aldehydes with acrylates. The MBH products were obtained in good yields (up to 85%) and with high enantioselectivities (up to 87% ee).
