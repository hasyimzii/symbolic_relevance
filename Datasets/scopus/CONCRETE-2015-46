All right reserved. 392 two-span continuous beams which are used HRB335, HRB400, HRB500 and HRB600 reinforcements are analyzed to investigate the bending moment amplitude modulation rule of concrete continuous beam with high-strength hot-rolled bar. The moment redistribution is investigated in two phases: One is the modulation amplitude βb caused from loading to steel yielding in control section of support. The other is βa caused from formation of a plastic hinge to the crushing of compressive extreme concrete fiber in control section of support. The results indicate that the plastic hinge appears delay and the rotation capacity of plastic hinge decreases, at the same time, the interval from the tensile extreme concrete fiber into the plastic to longitudinal reinforcement yielding ranges longer. The moment amplitude modulation coefficient equation using θp/h0 as the key parameters with a certain intercept βb has been obtained. Practical expression with ξ as independent variable has been proposed to facilitate the engineering applications.
