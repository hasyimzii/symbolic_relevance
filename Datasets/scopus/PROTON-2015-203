C and N Hybrid Coordination Derived Co-C-N Complex as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction




 
Â© 2015 American Chemical Society. Development of an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst composed of earth-abundant elements is scientifically and technologically important for the water splitting associated with the conversion and storage of renewable energy. Herein we report a new class of Co-C-N complex bonded carbon (only 0.22 at% Co) for HER with a self-supported and three-dimensional porous structure that shows an unexpected catalytic activity with low overpotential (212 mV at 100 mA cm-2) and long-term stability, better than that of most traditional-metal catalysts. Experimental observations in combination with density functional theory calculations reveal that C and N hybrid coordination optimizes the charge distribution and enhances the electron transfer, which synergistically promotes the proton adsorption and reduction kinetics.
