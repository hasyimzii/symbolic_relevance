Â© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Education is a crucial factor that determines labor market outcomes, especially for immigrants. This paper specifically examines the undergraduate major choice for Chinese immigrants and its relationship to their labor market outcome. Compared to other Asian groups and the mainstream society, Chinese immigrants are uniquely congregated in business and science categories. The level of popularity to a major is positively related to their labor market outcome. This finding reveals the current premarket educational investment pattern for Chinese immigrants and adds to the existing literature by focusing on how detail education quality in terms of major relates to labor market performance.
