Design of non-navigable span bridges of Hutong Changjiang River Bridge




 
Â© 2015, Journal Press, China Railway Bridge Science. All right reserved. The Hutong Changjiang River Bridge is designed to carry 4-track railways and 6-lane expressways. The non-navigable span bridges of the bridge are the simply-supported steel truss girder structures with span length of 112 m. The bridges are totally 2912 m long, of which the part of the bridges to cross the river dyke on the south bank has 3 spans and is 336 m long, to cross the river dyke on the north bank has 2 spans and is 224 m long and to cross the section of the Henggang Islet in the river has 21 spans and is 2 352 m long. The main trusses of the bridges are the three steel main truss structures. The upper highway decks are the structures composited by the steel stringers, steel cross beams and concrete deck slabs while the lower railway decks are the ones composited by the steel cross beams at the panel points at the lower chords and the concrete channel girders. The foundations for the piers of the bridges are all the bored piles and the pier shafts are the reinforced concrete three-cell single-box hollow structures.
