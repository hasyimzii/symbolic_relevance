Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) affect primary metabolite levels because CO2 is a direct substrate for photosynthesis. In several studies, the responses of primary metabolite levels have been examined using Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, but these results have not been comprehensively discussed. Here, we examined metabolome data for A. thaliana accession Col-0 leaves that were grown at elevated [CO2] with sufficient nitrogen (N) nutrition. At elevated [CO2], starch, monosaccharides and several major amino acids accumulated in leaves. The degree of accumulation depended on whether the rooting medium contained NH4 + or only NO3 -. Because low N conditions induce an increase in carbohydrates similar to that of elevated [CO2], we compared the responses of primary metabolite levels between elevated [CO2] and low N conditions. Levels of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-associated organic acids and major amino acids decreased with low N, but not with elevated [CO2]. Even at elevated [CO2], the low N induced the decreases in the levels of organic acids and major amino acids. A small sink size also affects the primary metabolite response patterns in leaves under elevated [CO2] conditions. Thus, care is necessary when interpreting primary metabolite changes in leaves of field-grown plants.
