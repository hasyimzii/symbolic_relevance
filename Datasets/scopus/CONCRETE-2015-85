To determine the supply systems of such a huge amount of the concrete for construction of the pier works, the general plans of the concrete mixing plants were made in the light of the riverbed elevation, the specific required amount of the concrete and also in consideration of the shallow and deep water areas. Through comparison of the supply capacity, construction difficulties, construction periods and construction cost of the two schemes of the steel platform mixing plant and hydraulic reclamation island mixing plant, it was finally determined that in the shallow water area, a reclamation island mixing plant should be applied. The height of the island would be about 6.1 m and at the outside of the surrounding dyke, a ring of the 1 m high and 0.3 m thick cast-in-situ concrete retaining wall would be arranged. In the deep water area, the steel platform mixing plants (made up of the steel pipe piles+pile top distribution beams+Bailey truss beams+steel floor systems) should be applied. For the reclamation island mixing plant in the shallow water, the surrounding dyke would be constructed first, the reclamation sand inside the cofferdam and the side slope protection outside the cofferdam would be then constructed. The rubble stone base would be laid and the concrete would be finally cast to form a platform. For the steel platform mixing plants, the steel pipe piles would be set and driven first and the bracing systems connecting the piles, the pile top distribution beams, platform main beams and the floor systems would be then successively constructed.
