Changing scenario in plant UV-B research:UV-B from a generic stressor to a specific regulator




 
Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Although UV-B accounts for < 0.5% of total sunlight energy reaching the earth's surface, however, it has multifaceted impact on plants as well as animals. High energy UV-B radiation is reported to have damaging impact on plant growth and productivity. After discovery of UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8), perceptions of biological impact of UV-B radiation on plants, have changed dramatically in last few years. This review focuses on the changing concept about the role of UV-B from a generic stressor to a specific regulator in plant science and has tried compiling the historical aspects of UVR8 starting with discovery, localisation and regulatory role played by UVR8 and also its interaction with other regulators.
