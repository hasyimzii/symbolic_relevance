A study on nonlinear analysis and confinement effect of reinforced concrete filled steel tubular column




 
Copyright Â© 2015 Techno-Press, Ltd. According to former studies, the mechanical properties of reinforced concrete filled tubular steel (RCFT) columns differed greatly from that of concrete filled steel tubular (CFT) columns because of interaction of inserted reinforcement in RCFT. Employing an experiment-based verification policy, a general FE nonlinear analysis model was developed to analyze the mechanical behavior and failure mechanism of RCFT columns under uniaxial compression. The reasonable stress-strain relationships were suggested for confined concrete, reinforcements and steel tube in the model. The mechanism for shear failure of concrete core was found out in the numerical simulation, and a none-conventional method and equation for evaluating the confinement effect of RCFT were proposed.
