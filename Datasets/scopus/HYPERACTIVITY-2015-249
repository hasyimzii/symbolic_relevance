The role of sleep problems and circadian clock genes in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and mood disorders during childhood and adolescence: an update




 
Â© 2015 Springer-Verlag Wien A more recent branch of research describes the importance of sleep problems in the development and treatment of mental disorders in children and adolescents, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mood disorders (MD). Research about clock genes has continued since 2012 with a focus on metabolic processes within all parts of the mammalian body, but particularly within different cerebral regions. Research has focused on complex regulatory circuits involving clock genes themselves and their influence on circadian rhythms of diverse body functions. Current publications on basic research in human and animal models indicate directions for the treatment of mental disorders targeting circadian rhythms and mechanisms. The most significant lines of research are described in this paper.
