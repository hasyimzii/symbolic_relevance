Transcriptome analysis of the variations between autotetraploid Paulownia tomentosa and its diploid using high-throughput sequencing




 
Â© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Timber properties of autotetraploid Paulownia tomentosa are heritable with whole genome duplication, but the molecular mechanisms for the predominant characteristics remain unclear. To illuminate the genetic basis, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to identify the related unigenes. 2677 unigenes were found to be significantly differentially expressed in autotetraploid P. tomentosa. In total, 30 photosynthesis-related, 21 transcription factor-related, and 22 lignin-related differentially expressed unigenes were detected, and the roles of the peroxidase in lignin biosynthesis, MYB DNA-binding proteins, and WRKY proteins associated with the regulation of relevant hormones are extensively discussed. The results provide transcriptome data that may bring a new perspective to explain the polyploidy mechanism in the long growth cycle of plants and offer some help to the future Paulownia breeding.
