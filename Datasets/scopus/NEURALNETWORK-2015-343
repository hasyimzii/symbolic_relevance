Robot dynamics identification via neural network




 
Â© 2015 IEEE. Recurrent neural network (RNN) - based approach to identification of underwater robot (UR) is considered and investigated in the paper. It was shown that RNN models can be successfully trained to nonlinear behaviour of a UR. Experiments carried out with data taken from UR dynamics model also confirmed effectiveness and prospective of the approach considered.
