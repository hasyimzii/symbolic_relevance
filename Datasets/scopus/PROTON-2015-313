© Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart · New York. We have developed an efficient method for the synthesis of trisubstituted (E)-vinyl bromides by a Friedel-Crafts-type addition of alkynes to oxocarbenium ions formed in situ from acetals. The success of this reaction relies on the identification of magnesium bromide etherate as both a Lewis-acid promoter and a source of bromide. This reaction employs simple inexpensive starting materials and proceeds under mild conditions to allow the preparation of a range of vinyl bromide products in high yields and high E/Z selectivities. Furthermore, the vinyl bromides also contain an allylic ether functional group. Both the vinyl bromide and allylic ether groups are effective handles for the elaboration of these useful synthetic intermediates.
