β-Aminobutyric acid increases drought tolerance and reorganizes solute content and water homeostasis in flax (Linum usitatissimum)




 
© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. β-Aminobutyric acid (BABA) is a non-protein amino acid that induces drought tolerance in plants. The mechanisms involved in this tolerance are still poorly understood. In the present study, metabolomic and ionomic profiling performed in flax (Linum usitatissimum) leaves revealed that BABA induces a major reorganization in solute content. This reorganization resulted in increased accumulation of non-structural carbohydrates and proline and a decrease in inorganic solutes. This response has high similarities with that obtained when flax is exposed to an osmotic stress. BABA treatment also induced a decrease in osmotic potential and a change in water status of flax leaves. These modifications are accompanied by an improvement in drought tolerance.
