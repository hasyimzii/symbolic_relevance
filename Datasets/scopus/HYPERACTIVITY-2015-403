Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder




 
Â© Copyright 2015 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental illness that can have devastating long-term consequences if untreated. Studies have shown that untreated individuals have worse outcomes than treated patients in academic, occupational, and social functioning; antisocial behavior; driving; substance use; and use of services. Family functioning is also highly affected by the child's ADHD and should be addressed by physicians. Recognition and management of ADHD in children is important so that their long-term outcomes can be improved. Differential diagnosis should include the possibility of comorbid psychiatric disorders and other developmental disorders. Neuropsychological testing may be valuable for both diagnosis and the assessment of treatment response.
