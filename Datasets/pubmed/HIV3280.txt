Soluble interleukin 2 receptors are elevated in patients with AIDS or at risk of  developing AIDS.
Utilizing an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, we detected elevated serum levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptors (SIL 2R) in 73% of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 80% of AIDS related complex patients, 78% of anti HIV positive lymphadenopathy syndrome patients, 85% of HIV antibody positive hemophiliacs, and 80% of anti HIV positive asymptomatic homosexual males, iv drug abusers, and heterosexual contacts. Of the subjects with no demonstrable antibody to HIV, 29% of hemophiliacs, 12% of adult homosexual males and iv drug abusers, and none of the patients with lymphadenopathy had elevated SIL 2R. Overall, only 5 of 40 antibody negative "high risk" individuals had SIL 2R values greater than the reference interval whereas 108 of 138 antibody positive individuals had elevated values (chi 2 = 57.85, P less than 0.001).
