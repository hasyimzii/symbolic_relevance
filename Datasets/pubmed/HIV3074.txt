Acute glandular fever like illness in a patient with HTLV III antibody.
A lymph node biopsy obtained from a patient with human T cell lymphocytotropic virus III/lymphadenopathy associated virus (HTLV III/LAV) antibody, presenting with an acute glandular fever like illness, was examined by electron microscopy. Numerous pathological changes were present in the biopsy, including hypertrophy of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, intracytoplasmic rod like inclusions within the cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum, multivesicular bodies, test tube and ring shaped forms, and tubulo reticular structures. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmic viral like particles measuring 105 120 nm in diameter and small cytoplasmic particles measuring 50 70 nm in diameter were found in some degenerating lymph node cells. These pathological findings may reflect a host cell response to various pathological and viral stimuli resulting from immune deficiency owing to infection with HTLV III/LAV.
