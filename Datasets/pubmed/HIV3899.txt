The Epstein Barr virus BZLF1 gene product activates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 5' long terminal repeat.
The Epstein Barr virus immediate early gene product BZLF1 transactivates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) long terminal repeat (LTR). The BZLF1 gene product caused an 18 fold increase in beta galactosidase activity from an HIV 1 LTR lacZ expression vector, whereas the HIV 1 transactivator tat caused a 44 fold increase in beta galactosidase activity. When cells were transfected with both BZLF1 (pEBV Z) and tat (pTAT3) expression vectors, as well as HIV 1 LTR lacZ plasmid (pLRON), a 214 fold increase in beta galactosidase activity was observed. This result suggests a synergistic effect of BZLF1 and tat on HIV 1 LTR directed lacZ gene expression. Analysis of quantitative BZLF1 and tat requirements for maximal HIV 1 LTR activation indicates that BZLF1 does not reduce the amount of tat required for maximal LTR activation, as would be expected if the BZLF1 synergistic effect was due to increased tat gene expression. Thus, coordinate effects of BZLF1 and tat on the HIV 1 LTR or its transcript are probably responsible for synergistic HIV 1 LTR activation.
