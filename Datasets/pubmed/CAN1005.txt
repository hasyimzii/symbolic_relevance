Estrogen receptors and MPA treatment in metastatic renal carcinoma. A preliminary report.
Ten previously untreated patients with metastatic renal carcinoma underwent transperitoneal radical nephrectomy followed by high dosage MPA treatment. Estrogen receptors were determined in the specimen of all cases by the dextran coated charcoal method: both the neoplastic tissue and the healthy parenchyma were tested. The disease progressed in 8 cases, and 2 patients are alive without any evidence of progressive disease 12 and 27 months after the operation. Very low receptor levels were detected in these 2 cases and one of them could be defined as borderline with our threshold criterion. However, receptors were undetectable in the neoplastic tissue from 4 of 8 patients who progressed. These questionable results justified the start of a prospective multicentric trial to study in a large number of cases both hormone receptors and clinical response to hormone therapy in human renal cancer.
