Clinical aspects of Down's syndrome from infancy to adult life.
Clinical pictures of mongoloid persons are demonstrated during different phases of life, with particular reference to the later one. Psychological and intellectual problems, immunologic deficiencies, and early aging are discussed. Histopathologic changes in the thymus are demonstrated. Because of the early aging of mongoloids, we examined the blood serum triglycerides, the cholesterol, and the LDL  and HDL cholesterol in Down's syndrome.
