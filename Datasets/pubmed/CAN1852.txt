Activity of carcinogens, carcinogen analogs, and metabolic inhibitors in the lymphocyte tritiated thymidine assay.
Inhibition of tritiated thymidine ([3H]dThd) incorporation into replicating DNA of concanavalin A (Con A) stimulated C57BL/6J splenic lymphocytes has been further evaluated as an end point for rapid in vitro discrimination between carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic chemicals. Results of this evaluation include: a) Inhibition of [3H]dThd incorporation into DNA of Con A stimulated cells clearly discriminated between known DNA damaging chemical carcinogens (N methyl N nitrosourea, 4 nitroquinoline 1 oxide, 4 (hydroxyamino)quinoline 1 oxide, benzo[a]pyrene, 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, and benz[a]anthracene) and non DNA damaging metabolic inhibitors of replication (dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, hydroxyurea, cycloheximide, potassium cyanide, and oligomycin). b) Inhibition of [3H]dThd incorporation also discriminated between carcinogens and noncarcinogens in the two pairs 4 nitroquinoline 1 oxide versus quinoline N oxide, and benzo[a]pyrene versus pyrene. c) Inhibition of [3H]dThd incorporation did not quantitatively discriminate between the structurally related strong carcinogen dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, the weak carcinogen benz[a]anthracene, and the equivocal carcinogens anthracene and phenanthrene. d) Inhibition of [3H]dThd incorporation was not a sensitive in vitro end point for the carcinogenic hypolipidemic drug 4 chloro 6 (2,3 xylidino) 2 pyrimidinylthioacetic acid (Wy 14,643).
