Prevalence of subclinical thyroid failure in insulin dependent diabetes.
A study was made of the distribution of primary thyroid failure, indicated by a raised serum TSH concentration, in 605 (294 males and 311 females) insulin dependent (type I) diabetics, aged 21 84 yr, not previously suspected of having thyroid disease. The prevalence of a raised serum TSH concentration in females of all ages (17%) was significantly greater (P less than 0.0005) than that in males (6.1%) and increased with increasing age at onset of diabetes (P less than 0.05) and age at time of study (P less than 0.001) in females but not in males. There was no significant difference in the duration of diabetes when comparing patients with normal and raised serum TSH concentrations. The prevalence of a raised TSH concentration in late onset insulin dependent diabetics was no greater in patients requiring insulin within 3 months of diagnosis of diabetes than in those exhibiting secondary sulfonylurea failure, who required insulin more than 3 months after diagnosis. In type I diabetes, the prevalence of subclinical primary thyroid failure is considerably greater than has previously been suspected, with female late onset insulin dependent diabetics being at the greatest risk.
