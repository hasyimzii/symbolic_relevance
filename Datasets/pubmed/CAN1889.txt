Rhabdomyosarcoma: report of a case with involvement of the angle of the mandible.
The most common signs of a malignancy in the region of the head and neck are evidence of a mass or symptoms arising from it. In this report a patient is described with rhabdomyosarcoma of the mandible. An incidental x ray taken some 3 months prior to the onset of clinical symptoms showed no evidence of bone involvement of the mandible. The onset of bone destruction of the angle and ascending ramus of the mandible as seen on a subsequent x ray can be placed somewhere in this period of time.
