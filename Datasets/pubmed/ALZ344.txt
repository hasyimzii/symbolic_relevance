Acute desensitization of lymphocyte beta adrenergic stimulated adenylate cyclase  in old age and Alzheimer's disease.
The effect of prior incubation with a single concentration of isoproterenol (10( 4) M) for 2 hours at 37 degrees C on isoproterenol stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in intact lymphocytes from young, old and subjects with Alzheimer's disease was studied. In lymphocytes from all three subjects groups prior incubation of cells with isoproterenol resulted in a significant reduction of cyclic AMP accumulation upon subsequent stimulation with isoproterenol.
