Spectrum of Kaposi's sarcoma in the epidemic of AIDS.
Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is seen with increased frequency in the course of the epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In this population, KS has manifested in an aggressive and more disseminated fashion as compared to the classical type. As the epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome continues to spread and more cases of KS are evaluated, a distinct diversity in the clinical presentation and in the course of the disease as well as in variation in the prognosis and response to therapy is being observed. A preliminary description of the spectrum of KS in the epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is presented here.
