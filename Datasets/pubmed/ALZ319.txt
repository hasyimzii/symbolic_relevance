Neurotransmitter receptors and monoamine metabolites in the brains of patients with Alzheimer type dementia and depression, and suicides.
In patients with Alzheimer type dementia, in addition to the well known losses of cholinergic neurones, there is evidence of degeneration of the noradrenergic and serotonergic innervation of the cerebral cortex. While noradrenergic and cholinergic receptors are preserved there is a loss of serotonin S1 and S2 receptors, particularly in the temporal lobe. The loss of serotonin S2 receptors may occur at an early stage of the disease and, in temporal and frontal cortex, is correlated with the loss of somatostatin immunoreactivity. In patients dying in hospital with depression, and in individuals committing suicide, there are no consistent changes in monoamine metabolites. Noradrenergic, serotonergic, and other neurotransmitter receptors were found to be unchanged, although there was a moderate decrease in imipramine binding in a small group (n = 6) of subjects with a history of depression, who had committed suicide.
