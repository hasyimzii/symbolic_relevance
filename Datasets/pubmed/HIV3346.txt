Human immunodeficiency virus related lymphocytic alveolitis.
We observed 276 HIV infected patients to determine the frequency, degree, and clinical presentation of the lymphocytic alveolitis in different stages of HIV disease, and also to identify the lymphocyte subsets involved. In 154 patients with proved lung infections or tumors (group A), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed lymphocytosis in 78 percent of cases. In 122 subjects (31 AIDS and 91 HIV infected non AIDS patients) without evidence of lung tumor or infection (group B), lymphocytic alveolitis was seen in 72 percent of cases. In 61 of 88 (69 percent) group B lymphocytic patients, we observed respiratory symptoms or diffuse interstitial opacities; however, we also observed such alveolitis in 27 of 46 (59 percent) group B patients free of respiratory symptoms and abnormality of chest x ray film. This alveolitis was seen not only in AIDS or ARC patients but also at earlier stages of HIV infection. T lymphocyte analysis showed a large majority (40 to 93 percent) of CD8 positive lymphocytes in the 37 patients tested. A dual fluorescence analysis revealed, in 18 subjects, that those cells were phenotypically cytotoxic (CD8 + D44 +). These findings suggest that, regardless of HIV infection stages and of opportunistic lung infections, a CD8 positive T lymphocyte alveolitis may be present in HIV infected patients and could be responsible for cough, dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, and abnormalities of pulmonary function tests.
