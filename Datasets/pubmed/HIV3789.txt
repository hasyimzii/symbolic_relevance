Crystallization of the Fab from a human monoclonal antibody against gp 41 of human immunodeficiency virus type I.
A monoclonal IgG antibody directed against gp 41 from the human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV 1) has been crystallized in both intact and Fab forms. Crystals of the intact antibody grow as tetragonal like prisms too small for conventional X ray analysis. However, the Fab portion of the antibody produces suitable plate like crystals which belong to the space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell constants of a = 66.5 A, b = 74.3 A and c = 105.3 A. There is one molecule of Fab in the asymmetric unit. The Fab crystals show diffraction to d spacings less than 3.0 A.
