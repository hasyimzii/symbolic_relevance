Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) antigens and genome in lymph nodes of HIV positive patients affected by persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (
The presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) antigens and genome has been investigated in 50 lymph nodes involved by persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL). All the patients were HIV infected and most of them (42 of 50) also had anti EBV serum antibodies. At lymph node level, HIV and EBV antigens were studied by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies directed against viral core proteins. The HIV p24 protein was detected in 43 of 50 lymph nodes within the B cell germinal centers with a reticular pattern. Few cells with positive results for EBV antigens were found in only 2 of 50 lymph nodes. These rare EBV positive centrocyte like cells were mainly located in the germinal centers. The presence of HIV and EBV genome was also studied in lymph nodes involved by PGL, with the use of in situ and Southern blot hybridization. A positive reaction for HIV genome was detected in only 1 of 14 lymph nodes with the Southern blot hybridization, and the presence of EBV genome was never demonstrated in these lymph nodes with the use of both in situ and Southern blot hybridization. The expression of EBV antigens and genome was also investigated in the peripheral blood of 15 patients with PGL in which cells with positive results for EBV antigens were detected in a single case with a frequency of 1 X 10( 4). No evidence of EBV genome was found with the use of the in situ hybridization. These results suggest that EBV is not present in lymph nodes during the PGL phase and that its possible implication in the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) associated lymphoma might be a late event.
