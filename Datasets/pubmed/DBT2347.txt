Proper management of diabetic surgical patients includes careful preoperative assessment, administration of adequate amounts of insulin and glucose during and after surgery, and frequent postoperative blood glucose determinations. With good control of blood glucose levels, many of the problems associated with surgery in diabetics can be prevented or improved.
