The dependence of Hb Al (glycohemoglobin) on age, pregnancy and glucose tolerance.
The dependence of Hb A1 on various factors was investigated. A dependence of age  of Hb A1 in normal persons could be proved. Moreover, significant differences of Hb A1 in pregnant women in the pre  and postnatal phase were proved. but the analyses carried out did not show any significant correlation between the weight of birth and the substance of glycohaemoglobin of pregnant women who were healthy in metabolism. In the protodiabetic stages the Hb A1 can as a diagnostic means contribute to the comprehension of a glucose intolerance in the protodiabetic stages. During a longer period of observations the Hb A1 shows a dynamic reaction of its concentration dependent of the glycaemic condition.
