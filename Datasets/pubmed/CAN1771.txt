Gastrectomy in siblings with Christmas disease (hemophilia B).
Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is regarded as one of the commonest clinical manifestations of classic hemophilia and Christmas disease. Although major surgery is usually avoided in such cases, recently we had 2 cases of Christmas disease in siblings who had undergone a successful gastrectomy and concomitant administration of a concentrated preparation of factor IX. In addition, findings in 7 other Japanese patients with hemophilia who underwent gastrectomy are discussed.
