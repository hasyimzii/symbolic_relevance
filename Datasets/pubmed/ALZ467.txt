Pedigree study of familial Alzheimer disease.
Twenty one families with familial Alzheimer disease were ascertained in a dementia clinic and assessed by multiple family interviews. Eight autopsies were reviewed. The age of onset varied from 25 to 85. Seven pedigrees showed evidence of 3 generation transmission. Paternal age of the founders of 4 lines which could be assessed was higher than controls.
