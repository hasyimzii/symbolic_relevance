Direct, fixed time kinetic assays for beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate with  a centrifugal analyzer or a computer backed spectrophotometer.
In the course of studying the control of blood glucose in juvenile onset diabetics, we developed convenient methods for determining beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. Here we describe fixed time, enzymic, reaction rate procedures for directly measuring these organic acids with a centrifugal analyzer (Rotochem IIA/36) or a computer backed spectrophotometer (Gilford 102 system). In either case, the method requires only 20 micro L of plasma; is rapid, accurate, and precise; and analytical recovery is quantitative. Data are presented comparing results obtained with both instruments. Metabolic acidosis can be rapidly assessed and monitored with these methods, as illustrated by an example.
