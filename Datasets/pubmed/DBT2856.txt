Effect of circulating insulin on liver damage by CCl4 in the rat. II. Histological aspects.
The authors have studied the damaging effects of CCl4 (0.05ml/Kg) in healthy rats, in alloxan diabetic rats and in rats treated with tolbutamide per os (100mg/Kg) for twenty days. Histological studies in these animals demonstrated that actually hyperinsulinemia has a slight protective action on damage produced by CCl4 on rat liver.
