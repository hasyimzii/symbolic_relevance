Lymphoma of the heart as an unusual cause of pericardial effusion. A case report.
A patient presented with cardiac tamponade which resolved after aspiration. Laboratory examination of the pericardial fluid and a biopsy specimen of the pericardium were diagnostically unhelpful. Surgical exploration revealed the presence of an extensive lymphoma involving the cavity and myocardium of the right atrium and right ventricle, with widespread systemic involvement. The initial response to surgical relief of obstruction to blood flow as satisfactory, and to date chemotherapy has been successful in preventing recurrence of the tumour.
