An empirical test of the two threshold model of disease transmission.
Recent research on diabetes mellitus has revealed the existence of at least two independent subtypes. The multifactorial analysis method suggested by Reich & co workers (1972) for testing the independence of transmission between subtypes of a complex disorder agrees with this distinction. These techniques were also sensitive to the non unitary nature of the mental retardation within a sample of subjects drawn from the data set of Reed & Reed (1965). Therefore, we believe that this analysis could be a valuable adjunct to the limited repertoire of methods currently available to psychiatric researchers for dealing with issues of differential diagnosis.
