Computed tomography of the bronchi. 2. Pathology.
Computed tomography (CT) can be used to diagnose both inflammatory and neoplastic diseases that arise from or affect the bronchi. The clarity of anatomic detail that can be obtained with CT is demonstrated. This clarity of anatomic detail should be of use in those cases for which bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or other staging procedures are planned. The overall usefulness of CT in patients with bronchial lesions has yet to be established.
