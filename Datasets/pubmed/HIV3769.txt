Non tropical pyomyositis in Germany.
Haematogenous primary pyomyositis predominantly caused by staphylococcus aureus is a well known entity in tropical regions. It is sporadicly observed in non tropical areas. Lack of clinical familiarity not seldom contributes to delayed recognition of pyomyositis in the suppurative or complicated state. Initially, healing usually can be achieved by antibiotic treatment adjusted by antibiotic treatment adjusted to pyogenic staphylococci. Late stages require concomitant surgical or transcutaneous drainages of pus. In addition, treatment for osteomyelitis or bacterial carditis as typical complications may be necessary. The review of pyomyositis is illustrated by three case reports from Germany.
