In vitro formation of amyloid fibrils from two synthetic peptides of different lengths homologous to Alzheimer's disease beta protein.
Two synthetic peptides corresponding to the reported 28 residue sequence of Alzheimer's Disease beta protein (SP28) and to residues 12 28 (SP17) were used to form fibrils in vitro. Synthetic fibrils bound Congo Red and closely resembled amyloid fibrils isolated from leptomeninges and senile plaques of Alzheimer's brain by electron microscopy. A polyclonal antiserum to SP28 specifically decorated both synthetic and native amyloid by colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy. Amyloid fibrils isolated from tissue were insoluble on SDS Polyacrylamide gels, and tended to aggregate while synthetic amyloid fibrils were completely solubilized, releasing only monomers of SP28 and SP17. Anti SP28 immunostained cerebrovascular and plaque core amyloid, but not neurofibrillary tangles, in tissue section. Western blot analysis showed that anti SP28 reacted with a 4 kDa band released from amyloid core enriched preparations and leptomeninges. By contrast, a 16 kDa band corresponding to the tetramer of beta protein was not recognized. These data suggest that as little as a 17 residue sequence of beta protein may be required to form fibrils and that the complete sequence of the 4 kDa beta protein may be important in determining insolubility and the formation of intermediate size polymers.
