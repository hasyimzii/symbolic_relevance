Association between serum insulin, serum somatomedin and liver receptors for human growth hormone in streptozotocin diabetes.
Streptozotocin induced diabetes in the female rat caused a decrease in the serum  level of somatomedin (Sm), measured by radioreceptor assay. The decrease was reversed by insulin therapy. In diabetes of varying severity, serum insulin and Sm levels showed highly significant association up to the insulin concentration (18 microU/ml) corresponding to normal serum Sm (1 U/ml). Similarly, the hepatic binding of human growth hormone (hGH) showed highly significant association with serum Sm levels up to the degree of binding (7% of tracer) corresponding to normal serum Sm. Binding of hGH to normal liver was about 12% of tracer. These results suggest that insulin might regulate serum Sm via its effect on liver lactogenic receptors, and that about half of these receptors are "spare", or in excess of those required to maintain normal serum Sm levels.
