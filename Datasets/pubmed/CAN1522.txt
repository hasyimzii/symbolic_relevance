Effects of cytochalasin B and colchicine on the motility and growth of Yoshida sarcoma cells in vitro.
The effects of cytochalasin B (CB) and colchicine on the motility and growth of cultured Yoshida sarcoma cells are studied by cinematographic methods. CB was found to reduce the average locomotory rate of motile Yoshida sarcoma cells and to enhance the frequency of non motile cells. On the other hand, colchicine enhanced only the frequency of non motile cells and did not affect the locomotory rate of motile cells. CB inhibited the growth of Yoshida sarcoma cells at the concentration range of 0.6 to 5 microgram/ml.
