Geriatric depression: a guide to successful therapy.
In the apathetic, withdrawn patient, tricyclic secondary amines such as desipramine and nortriptyline are as efficacious as tricyclic tertiary amines, and they offer the advantage of fewer anticholinergic and sedating side effects. Depressions usually have a sudden onset, whereas degenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease and multi infarct dementia are manifested gradually. However, many elderly demented patients have concomitant depression, making assessment difficult.
