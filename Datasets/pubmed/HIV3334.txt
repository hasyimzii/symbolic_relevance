Comparative analysis of gp41 antigens by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for detecting antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
We have compared the antigenic qualities of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) gp41 glycoprotein with a synthetic oligopeptide (peptide R21S) and a bacterially synthesized protein (protein 566), which are homologous with the N terminal region of gp41, in enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for detecting antibodies to HIV 1 in sera of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the aids related complex (ARC). Although the use of all three types of antigens readily allowed the detection of antibodies in human sera, ELISA employing purified gp41 glycoprotein and the protein 566 were more specific and sensitive than the peptide R21S ELISA.
