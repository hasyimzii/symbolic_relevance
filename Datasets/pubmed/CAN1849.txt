Clinical implications of glucocorticoid receptor studies in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
We have performed in parallel, in 19 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,  a quantitative determination of glucocorticoid levels, in vitro steroid induced inhibition of nucleic acid precursors, and a short term clinical trial of corticosteroids alone, before the treatment was given, which included corticosteroids and other drugs. From our results it appears that high glucocorticoid receptor levels in acute lymphoblastic leukemia of children do not guarantee a clinical response to corticosteroids. On the other hand, glucocorticoid receptors may turn out to be of value in predicting a poor response to corticosteroids only if their levels are considerably low.
