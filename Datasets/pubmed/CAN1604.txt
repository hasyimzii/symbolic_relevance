Anastomoses of the extrahepatic bile ducts with the duodenal stump (duodenocholecystostomy).
The article generalizes the experience of 11 anastomoses between the bile ducts and the duodenal stump in patients previously operated for ulcer or cancer. These operations were performed in obstruction of the hepatocholedochus resulting from an accidental lesion of bile ducts during resection of the stomach or less frequently by choledocholithiasis, sclerosis of the pancreas head.
