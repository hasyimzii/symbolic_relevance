Effects of pharmacologic hyperglucagonemia on plasma amino acid concentrations in normal and diabetic man.
Four normal and five insulin dependent diabetic men received a 2 h pharmacologic  glucagon infusion (50 ng/kg/min) resulting in plasma glucagon levels (4400 pg/ml) similar to those seen in glucagonoma patients. In normal subjects in whom plasma insulin concentrations rose significantly (239 uU/ml) and the blood level of 15 of the 18 amino acids measured fell significantly. In contrast, in the diabetic men who secreted no insulin in response to glucagon (no rise in C peptide levels), only 10 of 18 amino acid levels fell significantly. The branched chain amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine, as well as tyrosine and phenylalanine were among the 8 amino acids which showed no change in response to glucagon in the diabetics. Thus, glucagon appears to have no acute affect on branched chain amino acid levels in man.
