Polyglandular autoimmune disease and HLA.
We have studied 25 patients with polyglandular autoimmune disease with respect to HLA antigens. Whereas the combination of insulin dependent diabetes with Graves' disease or atrophic thyroiditis was associated with an increase in HLA B8, this was not found to be the case for patients with I.D.D.M. and goitrous thyroiditis. However 4/7 of these patients were DRw3 positive in contrast to previously established normal distribution of HLA B8 in patients with goitrous thyroiditis alone. These data suggest that patients with polyglandular failure may be highly selected for HLA B8/DRw3 positivity. We also report on two families with polyglandular autoimmune disease; the results suggest that these disorders are not necessarily transmitted with B8/DRw3 bearing haplotypes. In one family both the affected mother and non affected father were B8 positive. The mother's B8, which was associated with DRw7, BfF and Rga did not appear to be involved in the transmission of disease susceptibility to two affected offspring. The search for complete haplotypic arrangement should be pursued to see whether this uncommon haplotype arrangement is peculiar to autoimmune diseases.
