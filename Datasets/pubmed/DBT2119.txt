Intact antibody response to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides in uremia and diabetes.
To test their immune responsiveness to pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens, eight azotemic patients, ten dialysis patients, and five insulin dependent diabetics were vaccinated with a 14 valent vaccine. When compared with nonazotemic, nondiabetic control subjects, both diabetics and uremic patients responded with normal antibody titers to each antigen type. Therefore, we are advising immunization with commercially available vaccine in our patients with diabetes, renal failure, or both, although long term efficacy has yet to be proved.
