Low dose chenodeoxycholic acid for gallstone dissolution: a randomized trial in poor operative risk patients.
Thirty five patients, with minimally symptomatic radiolucent gallstones in well opacifying gallbladders who had an unusually high risk of operative mortality, were randomized, double blind, into three groups: group 1, placebo; group 2,250 mg chenodeoycholic acid (CDC)/day; group 3,375 mg CDC/day. Every six months, oral cholecystograms and duodenal bile were obtained. Serum was collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 months, then at 6 month intervals. After 6 months, all placebo patients were assigned to 375 mg CDC/day (group 3b). No changes occurred in group 1 (N = 15). Gallstones dissolution: group 2, 2/10; 1 complete (C), 1 partial (P); group 3, 4/10, 1C, 3P; group 3b, 2/12, 2C. Lowest dose with complete dissolution was 3 mg/k/day (actual body wt). Lithogenic index of bile only improved with 375 mg/day (1.27 +/  0.13 vs 0.88 +/  0.05; mean +/  SDM), P < 0.01. No diarrhea or serum biochemical changes occurred; however, three patients died of their other medical illness. Low fixed doses of CDC, although not optimal, dissolved stones without toxicity in very ill patients.
