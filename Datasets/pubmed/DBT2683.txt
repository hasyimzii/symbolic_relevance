Haemoglobin A1c: a predictor for the duration of the remission phase in juvenile  insulin dependent diabetic patients.
Increased HbA1c concentrations in diabetic patients indicate retrospectively a poor metabolic control during the preceding 2 3 months. In the present study attempts have been made to use the HbA1c concentration at the time of diagnosis as an indicator of the duration of the remission phase in 23 juvenile diabetic children. The regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the initial HbA1c concentrations and the duration of the remission phase defined as no glucose excretion, an insulin requirement of less than 0.5 U/kg/day and detectable serum C peptide concentration (r =  0.84, p < 0.001). The results suggest that the initial HbA1c concentration may serve as a useful indicator to predict the duration of the remission phase in juvenile onset diabetic patients.
