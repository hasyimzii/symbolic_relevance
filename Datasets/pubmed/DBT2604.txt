Multiple use of disposable insulin syringe needle units.
Fourteen insulin dependent diabetics were asked to use their insulin syringe needle units three times in succession to determine the efficacy and safety of this practice. The mean duration of time each patient participated in the study was 20.4 weeks, and a total of 2,000 injections were taken. No signs of infections at the injection site were observed. Multiple use of disposable insulin syringe needle units appears to be safe and cost beneficial.
