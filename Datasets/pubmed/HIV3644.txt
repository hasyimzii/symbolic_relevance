Susceptibility of EBV carrying B cell lines to infection by HIV 1: variability of production of progeny virus and expression of viral antigens.
We have examined 3 different EBV carrying B cell lines, in terms of ability to be super infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1), and have followed these lines, after infection by HIV 1, over a period of 3 months. We found significant variation among different HIV 1 strains in terms of the multiplicity of infection required to initiate infection in these EBV positive cell lines. Persistent infection by HIV 1 in the absence of detectable cytopathic effects could be demonstrated, as evaluated by a variety of techniques, including reverse transcriptase assay and immunofluorescence. The results indicate also that all of these cell lines produced progeny HIV 1 intermittently, with large amounts of virus production on some days but not others. In contrast, they were all able to continuously express p24.
