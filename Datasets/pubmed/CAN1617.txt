Utility of liver scintigraphy and angiography in preoperative detection of liver  metastasis from gastrointestinal carcinoma.
One hundred and seventy cases of cancer of digestive tract were separated into three groups, advanced gastric cancer, biliary and/or pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer. The presence of liver metastasis in each group was studied preoperatively by either liver scintigraphy or celiac and superior mesenteric angiography. In advanced gastric cancer and colorectal cancer, false negative ranged between 6.7 12.7 per cent by both scintigraphy and angiography. In biliary tract and/or pancreatic cancer, the ratio of false negative was significantly higher i.e. 18.8 22.6 per cent, which suggests the difficulty in diagnosing liver metastasis correctly in this group. The most frequent occurrences of false positive either in scintigraphy or angiography were those of masses of less than 2 cm in diameter. The difference in correct diagnosis ratio for liver metastasis between scintigraphy and angiography in all three groups was only 2.9 per cent. Hence, liver scintigraphy seems to be preferable for the purpose of detecting liver metastasis prior to surgery, since further angiographical examination entails irradiation, possible complications and economic factors.
