Suppression of bone marrow colony forming capacity by syngeneic T lymphocytes in AKR strain mice with lymphoblastic leukemia.
The effect of lymphocytes from the lymph nodes and thymus on bone marrow colony forming capacity was studied in AKR mice in the preleukemic and leukemic periods in vivo in the syngeneic donor recipient system. In the pre leukemic period, the lymphocytes do not change in the syngeneic stem cell colony forming index, while in spontaneous lymphoblastic leukemia they suppress bone marrow proliferative activity both in normal and leukemic mice and 62 100%.
