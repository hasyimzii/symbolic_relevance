Regulation by HIV Rev depends upon recognition of splice sites.
The ability of the Rev protein of HIV to regulate the cytoplasmic level of unspliced RNA from a beta globin gene containing the Rev response element was dependent on the integrity of the 5' and 3' splice sites. A beta globin pre mRNA containing the Rev response element is not under regulation by Rev but is made Rev responsive by a mutation at either the 5' or 3' splice site. These mutant RNAs accumulated in the nucleus as unspliced precursors owing to recognition by splicing components. Only in the presence of Rev did these unspliced RNAs appear in the cytoplasm. Thus, regulation by Rev probably involves the dissociation of splicing components and pre mRNA.
