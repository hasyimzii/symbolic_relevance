Acute myeloblastic leukaemia in the course of non Hodgkin's lymphoma (author's transl).
Five cases of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) arising in the course of non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are described. The initial lymphoma was nodular lymphoid poorly differentiated in 4 cases. All patients were under chemotherapy for at least 28 months, and 3 of them were irradiated. AML was diagnosed 44 to 78 months after NHL and was heralded in 3 cases by a preleukaemia phase of pancytopenia. The leukaemia was typically myeloblastic in 2 cases and difficult to classify in 3 cases. Death occurred rapidly in 4 patients. The actuarial risk was 4.5% at 5 years. Since AML's occur mainly in NHL's, the management of this type of lymphoma with favourable prognosis ought to be reevaluated.
