"Bleb" carcinoma of the lung.
The association of peripheral carcinoma of the lung with pre existing parenchymal scars is widely known. Since blebs are usually associated with subpleural scars, it is surprising that the clinical association of peripheral carcinoma and blebs has received scant attention in the surgical literature. Four surgical cases which illustrate this association are presented. This does not imply that large bullae require exploration or excision to exclude a possible occult carcinoma, but it is reasonable to conclude that any parenchymal lesion in association with large bullae in older patients should be viewed with more than ordinary suspicion of carcinoma.
