Ultrastructure of Alzheimer type II glia in hepatocerebral disease.
In a case of hepatocerebral disease of Inose type the astrocytes, corresponding to Alzheimer type II glia, had swollen cytoplasm containing glycogen granules and focal aggregates of lipofuscin granules. Their nuclei contained bodies of simple and of complex types as well as conglomerates of glycogen granules without any capsules. The nuclear bodies of simple type were also observed in the nuclei of endothelial cells. It is concluded that these changes in the appearance of Alzheimer type II glia suggest reactive and defensive changes in the brain against ammonium ions, rather than being merely degenerative in nature.
