Catecholamine neurons with Alzheimer's neurofibrillary changes and alteration of  tyrosine hydroxylase. Immunohistochemical investigation of tyrosine hydroxylase.
Immunohistochemistry with antisera against tyrosine hydroxylase was performed on  neurons with Alzheimer's neurofibrillary changes in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus. These specimens were obtained from brains with Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimer's type parkinsonism, parkinsonism dementia complex on Guam, and normal aging. Under these neurologic conditions the affected catecholamine neurons with Alzheimer's neurofibrillary changes were stained positively with antisera against tyrosine hydroxylase. The results suggested that in these neurons, Alzheimer's neurofibrillary changes seemed to develop independently before the reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase protein synthesis.
