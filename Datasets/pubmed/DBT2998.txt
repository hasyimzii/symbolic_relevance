Dopamine receptor binding is increased in diabetic rats.
The binding of [3H]spiperone, a dopamine receptor ligand, to striatal membranes was increased 30 to 35 percent in rats made diabetic with alloxan or streptozotocin. Binding of [3H]spiperone was normal in rats made diabetic with alloxan but treated with insulin. Thus the number of dopamine receptors and central dopaminergic transmission may be altered in diabetes.
