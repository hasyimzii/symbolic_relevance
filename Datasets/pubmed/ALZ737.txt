Cholinesterase activity in plasma, erythrocytes, and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type.
Cholinesterases, including pseudocholinesterase (BChE) of human plasma and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) of erythrocytes and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), have been considered as possible markers in dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Reported data, however, are widely varied, and no significant pattern emerges when total enzyme activity is assayed. In the present studies, we have reexamined the relationship of ChE activities in DAT and control patients. ChE activity was measured in plasma, erythrocytes, and CSF from DAT patients and compared with normal controls as well as with samples from patients with a diagnosis other than DAT. Early age onset (presenile) and late age onset (senile) DAT were also compared. No significant differences in total enzyme activity were found in any of the comparisons. Calculations of AChE/BChE ratios in CSF also provided no significant indication of any changes in ChE activities in DAT. It is suggested that measurements of total AChE or BChE activity in these biological materials do not provide a useful index of alterations in central cholinergic function in patients with DAT.
