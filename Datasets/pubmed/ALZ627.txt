Catecholamine metabolites and cyclic nucleotides in cerebrospinal fluid in dementia of Alzheimer type.
Three, 4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC); 3 methoxy, 4 hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HVA); 3 methoxy; 4 hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG); adenosine 3', 5' cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP); and guanosine 3', 5' cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) and controls. DOPAC levels were lower and HVA levels were higher in DAT patients than in controls. In the most rostral fractions of CSF from DAT patients there was a negative correlation between DOPAC and cyclic AMP levels. In addition, patients with onset of DAT symptoms before the age of 65 had lower DOPAC levels, a higher HVA/DOPAC ratio, and higher cyclic nucleotide levels than patients with late onset of DAT. By combining DOPAC and cyclic AMP levels, we could clearly distinguish these two groups.
