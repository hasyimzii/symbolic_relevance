Augmented induction of tumor specific resistance by priming with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TBC) and subsequent immunization with PPD coupled syngeneic tumor cells.
The present study investigates the augmenting effect of tuberculin  (PPD) reactive amplifier T cells on the induction of syngeneic tumor immunity. PPD reactive helper (amplifier) T cell activity was generated in C3H/HeJ mice by appropriate immunization with heat killed Mycobacterium (Tbc). Immunization of these Tbc primed mice with PPD coupled syngeneic X5563 tumor cells led to augmented generation of in vivo tumor neutralizing activity contingent on the presence of PPD reactive amplifier T cell activity. Splenic T cells from these mice exhibited potent tumor neutralizing activity using Winn's assay, whereas spleen cells from mice not primed with Tbc before PPD X5563 immunization failed to neutralize viable X5563 tumor cells. After establishing that the neutralizing activity was tumor specific and mediated by T cells, the applicability of this augmentation of tumor specific immunity to an immunotherapy model was explored. Immunization with PPD X5563 in the early stages of the tumor bearing state induced potent anti tumor activity sufficient to reject the growing tumor. Pretreatment of mice with cyclophosphamide or light x irradiation (250 R), procedures that eliminate suppressor cell activity nonspecifically, before priming with Tbc further potentiated the anti tumor activity under these conditions. Thus, the present study elucidates the augmenting effect of PPD reactive amplifier T cells in the induction of tumor specific immunity and provides an effective method of immunotherapy in tumor bearing animals.
