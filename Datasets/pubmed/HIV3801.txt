Potential therapeutic applications of PHA L4, the mitogenic isolectin of phytohemagglutinin.
Assuming that the attributes of the mitogenic leukoaggglutinating (L4) isolectin  of phytohemagglutinin as a proposed ideal biologic response modifier can be confirmed, it could prove to be a highly versatile agent with broad therapeutic potential for several areas of management including cancer and cancer surgery adjuvant, critical infections (including that with the human immunodeficiency viruses), vaccine adjuvant, allograft transplantations, aplastic anemias, and extensive burns. The isolectin is predictably more likely to be effective as an adjuvant or adjunctive agent than as an induction agent. Initial evaluation in dogs would serve the double purpose of establishing a presumptive key role in veterinary medicine and expediting the development of its use in humans.
