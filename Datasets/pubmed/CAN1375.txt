Site of recurrence of cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy.
Of 564 patients who underwent radical hysterectomies for cervical cancer. 104 had recurrences. Twenty (3.5%) had recurrence in the central pelvis, and in nine (1.6%), this was the only site of recurrence. Of the patients who had lymph node metastases at the time of radical hysterectomy, 40% subsequently had recurrence compared with 14% who had negative nodes and recurrence. The site of recurrence, however, had no relationship to lymph node involvement, size of the lesion, stage of disease, cell type or grade, or previous pelvic irradiation.
