Supervision of the postoperative period in biliary shunt operations: validity of sequential hepato biliary scintiphotography with 99mTc HIDA.
The Authors' aim was to assess the effectiveness of Sequential Scintiphotography  of the Liver with 99mTc HIDA (SSFH) in the evaluation of post operative jaundice, in operations of biliary derivation (43 observations in 28 patients). SSFH proved to be highly reliable even in comparison with more laborious procedures (such as Transhepatic Cholangiography), and superior to equally simple procedures such as Echo Tomography and Computerised Tomography, evidencing itself as the investigation of choice for the study of this pathology, especially in long term follow ups.
