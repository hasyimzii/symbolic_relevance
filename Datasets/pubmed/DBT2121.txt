Pathophysiological states modify levels in rat plasma of factors which inhibit synthesis and enhance breakdown of
We have shown recently that adaptive changes in the apparent amount of enzymes which synthesize and inactivate prostaglandins (PGs) occur in a reciprocal manner (see accompanying paper and refs 2 4). For example, PG synthetase activity in
