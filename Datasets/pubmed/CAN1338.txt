Postcricoid pseudotumor.
Normal anatomic structures may cause filling defects in the anterior wall of the  hypopharynx and upper esophagus on an esophagogram, suggestive of a mass lesion. I have called this finding postcricoid pseudotumor, to emphasize the ease with which it may misleadingly simulate a tumor mass.
