Intra uterine growth in infants of diabetic mothers.
The birth weight, length, head circumference and body proportions of infants born to women with well controlled diabetes were compared with those of infants born to poorly controlled diabetics. The latter infants were significantly heavier, with a greater weight/length ratio and a smaller head circumference/weight ratio, while their length, and head circumference/length ratio were appropriate for age. The size and body proportions of infants born to well controlled diabetics were normal. Hairiness of the pinna was observed in infants born to both well  and poorly controlled diabetics, and may prove to be a useful clinical sign in identifying the infant of a diabetic mother.
