Transformation of BHK 21/CL 13 cells by various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  using the method of Styles.
Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated by the cell transformation assay method of Styles. Benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P], chrysene (CH), 3 methylcholanthrene (3 MC), benz(a)anthracene (BA), benzo(b)fluoranthene [B(b)F], and dibenz(a,h)anthracene (DBA) were tested, including liver homogenate, and showed dose effect relationships and a more than 2 fold increase of transformation rates at LC50. Due to variations of the test method our results differed quantitatively from the data published by Purchase and Styles. Discrimination between the known carcinogens listed above and the noncarcinogens, phenanthrene (PA) and anthracene (AC), lacking a dose effect relationship was, however, possible. Benzo(e)pyrene [B(e)P] was regarded as positive although producing only a 2 fold increase in the number of transformed colonies.
