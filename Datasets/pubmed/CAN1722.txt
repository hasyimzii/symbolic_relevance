Impulse cytophotometric studies on DNA in bladder carcinoma.
The applicability and the significance of quantitative cellular DNA estimations by rapid flow cytofluorometric techniques are discussed for newly diagnosed tumours and in the treatment of carcinoma in situ of the bladder. From the DNA histograms, the degree of ploidy and the proportion of S phase cells, indicating the proliferation activity of the tumours, are determined. Diploid DNA patterns are found in 60% of T 1 tumours while the other tumours, including carcinoma in situ, are almost exclusively aneuploid. With few exception, Grade 1 tumours are diploid and Grade 3 tumours are aneuploid; the dividing line between diploid and aneuploid DNA patterns passes through Grade 2 tumours 60% of which are diploid and 40% aneuploid. Among the aneuploid tumours, the tetraploid cases exhibit the least malignant characteristics. The aneuploid non tetraploid tumours increase in malignancy the more they deviate from tetraploidy. A possible explanation is the observed increase in the number of S phase cells correlated to the deviation from tetraploidy. The DNA measurements have also been used for the objective assessment of therapeutic results in cases of carcinoma in situ treated by local instillation of adriamycine.
