Major hepatic resections for angioma.
6 cases of solitary angioma of the liver, treated with major hepatic resections,  are presented (2 rt hemihepatectomies   2 lt hemihepatectomies   1 lt lateral sect. and 1 segmentectomy of the VIth). Their anatomopathological definition (solitary angioma, multiple angiomas, hemangiomatosis) is discussed in relation to the various therapeutic possibilities. From the diagnostic standpoint, an outstanding part is played by angiography. In addition to demonstrating the presence of hepatic mass, C.A.T. can, according to their experience, also allow diagnosis of quality on the basis of demonstration of vascular lacunae. It is considered that the treatment of choice of for solitary angiomas is surgery, which must be performed by skilled surgeons and consist in hepatic resections conduced by typical route. This is especially true for the giant forms, owing to their particular tendency to growth and spontaneous rupture. For small angiomas it is considered better in principle to remove them, generally by small cuneiform resections, unless they are situated in sites difficult to attack surgically and with high risk. In this case frequent check up is necessary since, although they are sometimes found to be stationary and even in exceptional cases regressive, personal experience (2 cases) has demonstrated a tendency to expansion.
