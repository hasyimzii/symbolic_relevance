Tumor cell phagocytosis. Its occurrence in a patient with medulloblastoma.
Phagocytosis was observed in tumor cells from a metastatic medulloblastoma to the bone marrow. Erythrocytes and leukocytes were seen in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Another abnormal finding was self phagocytosis, in which tumor cells engulfed one another. The mechanism of tumor phagocytosis is not yet clearly understood. Only a few cases of erythrophagocytosis by epithelial tumor cells have been reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a medulloblastoma with hematophagocytosis.
