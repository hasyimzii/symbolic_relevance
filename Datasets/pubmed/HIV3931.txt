Synthesis of N substituted 3' amino 3' deoxythymidines and their biological evaluation against HIV.
Treatment of 3' amino 3' deoxythymidine (1) with carboxylic acid anhydrides afforded the corresponding acylamino derivatives 2a f. Reaction of 1 with a variety of isothiocyanates led to the corresponding thioureido derivatives 3a i. Also, conversion of 1 into 3' carbylamino 3' deoxythymidine (7) is reported. The compounds 2, 3, and 8 were evaluated for their anti HIV activity in MT 4 cells, but did not show sufficient efficacy.
