Substance P immunoreactivity within neuritic plaques.
In the present immunocytochemical study we examined brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease in order to determine the relationship of substance P (SP) labeled processes to neuritic plaques. Swollen neuropeptidergic processes were consistently observed within a relatively small percentage of the plaques. These data provide a morphologic correlate to the biochemical finding that SP levels are reduced in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and further indicate that Alzheimer's disease affects multiple neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems.
