Cardiac denervation and other multisystem manifestations caused by isolated autonomic neuropathy in a young diabetic patient.
A young, diabetic woman suffering from fainting spells, vomiting, and diarrhea is described. Extensive investigations showed total cardiac denervation, orthostatic hypotension, and disturbances in the the pupillary and sudomotor functions, as well as impairment of glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia. These disturbances were found to be caused by autonomic neuropathy. No signs of peripheral neuropathy could be detected. To the best of our knowledge this is the second case of total cardiac denervation due to diabetic neuropathy described in the literature.
