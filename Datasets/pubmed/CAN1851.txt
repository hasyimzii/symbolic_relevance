Ellipticine induced changes in cell growth and nuclear morphology.
Twenty four hour exposure of Friend leukemia (FL) and L1210 cells to 1.0 micrograms ellipticine/ml resulted in a slowdown in cell proliferation, accumulation of cells in G2 phase, an increase in cellular RNA content, and an increase in the proportion of cells with greater than 4C (tetraploid) content of DNA in both cell lines. Removal of the drug and subsequent cell culturing in fresh medium for 24 hours led to a further increase in the proportion of cells having more than a 4C content of DNA, with no change in cell number, in FL cell cultures. Distinct micronucleation and an increase in cell size without any sign of cell division were seen in FL cells so treated. In contrast, L1210 cells after transfer to fresh medium reentered the normal cell cycle, continued to proliferate, and demonstrated only a slight increase in cells with greater than a 4C content of DNA within 24 hours of removal of the drug.
