Possible viral interactions in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Viral interactions may occur whenever a host is infected simultaneously with two  viruses. Persons at high risk for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) may provide a substrate for such interactions. These could include complementary immunosuppression, potentiation of infection by altered receptors or genetic complementation, phenotypic mixing, or genetic recombination. The possibility of such interactions should be considered in the pathogenesis of AIDS.
