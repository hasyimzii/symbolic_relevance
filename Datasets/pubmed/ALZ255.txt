Philothermal response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in dementia of the Alzheimer type.
The philothermal response, i.e., the tendency of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to migrate along a temperature gradient toward warmer temperatures, was evaluated in 11 patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and compared to 11 age and sex matched mentally normal individuals. While the total number of migrating PMNs did not differ significantly between these two groups, there was a significant difference in the spatial distribution of the responding cell population. The numerical parameter, R, has been introduced to provide a quantitative measure of the distribution of populations characterized by differences in motile behavior. This R value was unusually high for 10 of the DAT patients but only one of the comparison individuals. No relation between R and duration of illness, age, or sex was detected. These preliminary findings, based on a small number of clinically diagnosed DAT patients, suggest that the philothermal response may represent a biological marker with diagnostic usefulness for at least one subgroup of DAT patients.
