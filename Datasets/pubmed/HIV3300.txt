Clonal analysis of functional differences among strains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Different isolates (HTLV IIIB, LAV1 and ARV2) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were cloned by a plaque forming assay using MT 4 cells. The reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and plaque forming unit (PFU) titers of all viral preparations were assayed. PFU/RT values, which indicate the relative proportions of incomplete and infectious viruses, were used for determination of viral infectivity. High values were obtained mainly for clones of HTLV IIIB and LAV1, and low values for ARV2 derived clones, suggesting that ARV2 and its clones were genetically less infectious. For studies on cytocidal effects of the viruses, four clones of HTLV IIIB, LAV1 and ARV2 were selected that had similar PFU/RT (infectivity) values for proliferation in infected MT 4 cells. When compared at the same dose (MOI), one clone (HTLV IIIB C 2) was found to be more cytocidal than the others. Furthermore, plaques induced by HTLV IIIB C 2 were larger than those induced by other clones, suggesting that the release of progeny from HTLV IIIB C 2 infected cell and their proliferation were the most efficient. Among the cloned viruses tested, three were found to induce strong cytopathic changes (fusion and ballooning) selectively in MT 4 cells. Thus, the infectivity, proliferation and cytopathic fusion effects were proposed to be encoded by the viral genome and be separable by the plaque cloning method.
