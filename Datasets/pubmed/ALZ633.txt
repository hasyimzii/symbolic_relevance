Clinical studies of the cholinergic deficit in Alzheimer's disease. I. Neurochemical and neuroendocrine studies.
Autopsy studies indicating that cholinergic neurons are selectively lost in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) suggest that peripheral markers for central cholinergic activity would be useful in diagnosis. The present studies found that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment (r = .70) in a sample of carefully diagnosed patients with AD/SDAT, but metabolites of other neurotransmitters were not related to cognitive state; this suggests that CSF ACh may be a valid measure of cholinergic degeneration. Cortisol and growth hormone were measured in plasma samples drawn from patients and controls every 30 minutes from 2100 to 1100 hours the next day. Mean plasma cortisol concentrations were higher in patients with AD/SDAT than in controls and correlated inversely with CSF methoxy hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) (r = .61) and positively with degree of cognitive impairment (r = +.53); as anticholinergic drugs suppress cortisol this finding indicates that cortisol dysregulation may be a marker for abnormalities in other neurotransmitter systems, particularly the noradrenergic system. Growth hormone secretion was not different in patients and controls but was positively correlated with CSF MHPG (r = +.63).
