The detection of islet cell antibodies by immunofluorescence in Bouin's fixed, paraffin embedded human pancreas.
Pancreatic islet cell antibodies have been demonstrated in the sera of insulin dependent diabetic patients, with or without polyendocrine disease, by immunofluorescent microscopy in which cryostat sections of fresh frozen human pancreas were used as the substrate. In the present study we used sections of Bouin's fixed, paraffin embedded, trypsin treated human pancreas as the islet cell substrate and compared the results to those obtained with cryostat sections. Twenty four sera from insulin dependent diabetic patients, one serum from a non insulin dependent diabetic patient and five sera from normal individuals were tested. With serum samples containing islet  cell antibodies, Bouin's fixed, paraffin embedded tissue produced a more intense fluorescence, was easier to use and was more sensitive than the conventional cryostat method.
