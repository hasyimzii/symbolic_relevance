Chronic schizophrenia: a risk factor for HIV?
Chronic mental patients may constitute a previously unrecognized high risk group  for the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus. This paper briefly reviews the literature on sexual awareness, sexuality, substance abuse, and schizophrenia, and addresses the problems of implementing sex education programs for chronic mental patients. Although problematic, such preventive programs are urgently needed.
