Vascular responsiveness and serum biochemical parameters in alloxan diabetes mellitus.
Responses of isolated aorta and portal vein (PV) to norepinephrine (NE), angiotensin II (AII), KCl, and CaCl2 were investigated in alloxan diabetic rats. Based on serum biochemical parameters (i.e., glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and creatinine) (alloxan, 150 mg/kg), diabetic rates were divided into three groups: 1) mildly diabetic at 1 week (only elevated glucose levels), 2) moderately diabetic at 4 wk (elevated glucose, triglycerides, and creatinine), and 3) severely diabetic at 8 wk (all serum biochemical parameters elevated). The sensitivity (i.e., ED50) of aortic smooth muscle from diabetic rats when compared to saline controls was 1) unchanged in mild diabetes; 2) decreased to KCl, AII, and CaCl2 in moderate diabetes; and 3) decreased to KCl, NE, and CaCl2 in severe diabetes. Ability of aortic smooth muscle to develop maximal contractions (i.e., contractility) to all these agonists was markedly diminished in severe diabetes. Spontaneous phasic contractions of PV from diabetic rats exhibited progressively greater tension as the disease advanced. Unlike aortas, contractility of PV to vasoactive agents was not affected at any stage of diabetes. PV sensitivity to AII in moderate diabetes and to Ca in severe diabetes was decreased when compared to saline controls. These differences in reactivity and contractility of aorta and PV in progressive stages of experimental diabetes could be due to alterations in calcium handling and its metabolism in arterial and venous smooth muscle cells in the diabetic state.
