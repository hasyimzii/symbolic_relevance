Factors provoking the development of rubeosis iridis after vitrectomy in diabetics (author's transl).
A retrospective study on 184 eyes of 167 diabetics which had been submitted to a  vitrectomy because of various affections of the vitreous body and retina shows, that aphakic eyes, cases suffering from repeated bleeding into the vitreous cavity, and eyes with advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy are mostly preposed to the development of rubeosis iridis. Coincidence of two of these factors was found in more than two thirds of the eyes with post operative rubeosis iridis. The stage of the diabetic retinopathy was preoperatively determined by means of ultrasonography.
