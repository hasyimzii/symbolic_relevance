Downregulation of cell surface molecules during noncytopathic infection of T cells with human immunodeficiency virus.
Noncytopathic infection of human T lymphoid cell line CR 10 with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (CEM N1T isolate) resulted in a gradual loss of cell surface receptors for OKT4/OKT4A (HIV receptor), OKT8, OKT3, and OKT11 but not for OKT9 (transferrin receptor) within 10 days after infection. Surface receptor decline was accompanied by a rapid increase in HIV antigens and mRNA expression. Multireceptor downregulation was also observed in three T lymphoid cell lines (MT 4, CEM, and HBD 1) cytopathically infected with the HIV/N1T virus and in HUT 78 cells infected with the HIV/SF 2 isolate. HIV infected and uninfected CR 10 cells contained similar levels of mRNAs coding for T3, T8, T9, T11, HLA A2, and HLA B7 proteins. By densitometry, fully infected CR 10 cells showed approximately 75% reduction in T4 and tubulin (beta chain) mRNA levels when compared with uninfected CR 10 cells. No such reduction was detected in HIV infected MT 4 and HBD 1 cells. A T cell receptor gene (beta chain) rearrangement study revealed that no distinct CR 10 subpopulation was selected out upon infection with HIV. Our results suggest that the reduction in cell surface receptors observed between 1 and 2 weeks postinfection cannot be directly attributed to similar reductions in mRNA levels coding for these receptor proteins. We conclude that HIV infection induces posttranscriptional downregulation of several T cell surface receptors.
