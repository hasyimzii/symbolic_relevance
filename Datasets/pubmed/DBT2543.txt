Semiquantitative determination of glucose in urine with a new test kit.
A new testing set for diluting urine allows to determine glucose in urine with the Diabur test strip up to a concentration of 8.0 g/dl. The dilution by means of a pipette is absolutel;y practicable at a distinguished precision; the results show an excellent correlatiopn with the quantitative hexokinase method. Of all possible interfering substances tested only ascorbic acid influenced the reaction which, however, interfered only when minor glucosuria was present.
