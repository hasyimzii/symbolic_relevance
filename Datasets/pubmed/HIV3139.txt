Clinical, immunological, and virological aspects in Japanese hemophiliacs and AIDS patients.
To date, 16 cases of AIDS have been officially reported in Japan: 8 of them were  hemophiliacs and the others were male homosexuals. We had two hemophiliacs with AIDS, and describe these cases in this paper. One was a 48 year old man with hemophilia B and the other was a 62 year old man with hemophilia A. Both had ARC symptoms before developing overt and fatal opportunistic infections, candidiasis and a combination of atypical mycobacteriosis and aspergillosis. Impairment of cellular immunity such as lowered T4/T8 ratio, depressed lymphocyte response to mitogen and NK activity, and negative PPD skin reaction was evident in both patients. Anti LAV/HTLV III antibodies were detected in their sera, and the retrovirus was demonstrated in the lymph nodes and other organs on the postmortem electron microscopic examination. The assay for anti LAV/HTLV III on 70 other hemophiliacs in our clinic revealed seropositivity up to 50%. The seropositive group showed a significantly lower T4/T8 ratio on an average than the seronegative group. The prevalence of seropositivity for antibodies to other viruses including HBV, EBV, CMV, PV, and HTLV I was markedly higher in the hemophiliacs. In LAV/HTLV III seropositive hemophiliacs, however, no distinct correlation was found between T4/T8 ratio and the presence of antibodies to other viruses. There is a retrospective study to show that LAV/HTLV III seropositive hemophiliacs appeared as early as 1980 in Japan. For prevention of LAV/HTLV infection in hemophiliacs via blood products, heat treated factor concentrates have recently become available. In a trial of the heat treated products on 15 "virgin" hemophiliacs, no seroconversion has occurred thus far.
