Influence of diabetes on oxidation of exogenous substrates in rat aorta.
The influence of diabetes on the oxidation of exogenous glucose, pyruvate, beta hydroxybutyrate and palmitate was studied in rat aorta. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (65 mg/kg). The metabolic processes were measured during incubation in vitro for 90 180 min. After a diabetes duration of two weeks the oxidation of glucose, pyruvate and beta hydroxybutyrate was lowered while the oxidation of palmitate was unaffected. The effect of diabetes on glucose oxidation appeared after 24 h and was more pronounced after 48 and 96 h. The lowered glucose oxidation in diabetic aorta was still present after incubation of rat aorta in organ culture for 48 h. Insulin treatment increased the glucose oxidation in diabetic aorta after 24 h and after 48 h the glucose oxidation in diabetic aorta was markedly increased. Incubation of diabetic aorta in organ culture for 48 h with insulin added to the incubation medium did not increase its glucose oxidation. Pretreatment of rats with diazepam and phentolamine before sacrifice, did not influence glucose oxidation or lactate production in vitro. Addition of albumin to the incubation medium slightly increased glucose oxidation but did not affect lactate production. The alternations in substrate oxidation in diabetic rat aorta found in this study are qualitatively similar to those found in diabetic striated muscle.
