Therapy and follow up in pheochromocytoma.
Following a brief presentation of signs and symptoms in 13 patients with pheochromocytoma, the modern procedures for correct diagnosis and tumor localization are outlined. The importance of adequate preoperative treatment with alpha  and, if necessary, beta adrenergic receptor blocking agents is stressed. The authors also show how the sudden life threatening blood pressure changes which used to occur frequently during surgical manipulation of the tumor can now be reliably avoided. Pheochromocytoma may arise multifocally; moreover, because the coincidence of pheochromocytoma and associated tumors such as medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland, adenoma of the parathyroid gland, mucosal neuroma, neurofibroma and chemodectoma is considerably higher amongst these patients and their relatives, it is essential to follow up not only patients with pheochromocytoma but also their relatives, in order to detect recurrences or other neoplasms in time.
