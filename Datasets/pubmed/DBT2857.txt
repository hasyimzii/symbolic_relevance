Effect of circulating insulin on liver damage by CCl4 in the rat. I. Biochemical studies.
The authors have studied the damaging effects of CCl4 (0.05ml/Kg) in healthy rats, in alloxan diabetic rats, and in rats treated with tolbutamide per os (100mg/Kg) for twenty days. Biochemical studies in these animals demonstrated that actually hyperinsulinemia has a preventive effect in relation to the damage produced by CCl4 as demonstrated by a decrease in bilirubinemia and transaminasemia.
