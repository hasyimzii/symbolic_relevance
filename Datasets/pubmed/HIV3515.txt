Preliminary evidence that azidothymidine does not affect hepatitis B virus replication in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients.
The effect of azidothymidine (AZT) on hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication was determined in three patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Serum viral DNA was present, and its concentration either remained the same or increased in two patients. Since AIDS patients may be infected with a variety of viral agents in addition to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the effects of the antiviral agents and biological modifiers on other common viral infections should also be determined in developing new approaches to HIV infection. Our results give preliminary evidence that AZT does not affect HBV viral replication in vivo.
