Effect of interleukin 1 on the augmentation of human immunodeficiency virus gene  expression.
Among the cytokines tested here (IL 2, IL 3, IL 4, IL 5, IL 6, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G CSF), granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM CSF), interferon alpha (IFN alpha), interferon beta (IFN beta) and interferon gamma (IFN gamma] only interleukin 1(IL 1) augmented HIV long terminal repeat(LTR) directed chloramphenicol acetyl transferase(CAT) activity in protein kinase C(PKC) independent manner. However, a stimulation by IL 1 was not as efficient as that due to tumor necrosis factor and the HIV production was not significant. IL 1 was not cytotoxic to MOLT 4/HIV cells.
