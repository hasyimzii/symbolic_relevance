Evaluating a learning device for juvenile diabetic children.
The purpose of this study was to determine if knowledge of diabetes could be increased through use of a learning device designed for insulin dependent diabetic children, aged 7 12 yr. The instrument, consisting of a book and game, combines cognitive and affective elements to provide diabetic information and to reinforce and to evaluate this knowledge in subjects. Serial exposure to the instrument resulted in a significant increase in knowledge and retention of information in 26 experimental subjects. Five subjects receiving one teaching intervention showed an initial increase in knowledge, but without reinforcement, demonstrated minimal retention. Six control subjects, receiving no intervention, showed no increase in knowledge.
