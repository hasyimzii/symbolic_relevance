Phenolic constituents of licorice. II. Structures of licopyranocoumarin, licoarylcoumarin and glisoflavone, and inhibitory effects of licorice phenolics on xanthine oxidase.
An anti HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) phenolic constituent, licopyranocoumarin (4), and two other new phenolics named licoarylcoumarin (5) and glisoflavone (6) were isolated from Si pei licorice (a commercial licorice; root and stolon of Glycyrrhiza sp. from the north western region of China) using droplet countercurrent chromatography and centrifugal partition chromatography, and their structures were assigned based on chemical and spectroscopic data. Kaempferol 3 O methyl ether (7) and licocoumarone (8) were also isolated from the licorice. The inhibitory effects of ten licorice phenolics on xanthine oxidase were examined. Licochalcone B (1), glycyrrhisoflavone (2), 8 and licochalcone A (19) showed 50% inhibition at the concentration of 1.3 5.6 x 10( 5) M.
