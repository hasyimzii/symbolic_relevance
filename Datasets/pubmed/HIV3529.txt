Focal epithelial hyperplasia (Heck's disease) in a Sudanese girl: case report.
Focal epithelial hyperplasia is a rare oral mucosal condition with ethnic and familial patterns of prevalence. The exact aetiology is unknown, but a viral aetiology was suggested. The condition does not require any treatment and will regress spontaneously. A recent report considered the condition one of the oral manifestations of HIV infection. The present case report is on focal epithelial hyperplasia affecting a 9 year old Sudanese girl. The case is discussed with special emphasis on the importance of a correct diagnosis.
