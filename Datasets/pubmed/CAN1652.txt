Computed tomography of musculoskeletal disorders of the truncus.
Computed Tomography (CT) is a new diagnostic tool in the evaluation of the musculoskeletal system. In the present study 29 patients with benign or malignant lesions in the body have been examined by this method. The purpose has been to evaluate the value of CT scanning in disorders of the musculoskeletal tissues. CT is an effective modality for demonstrating the three dimensional extent of lesions, but in about one third of the cases the examinations were not able to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions.
