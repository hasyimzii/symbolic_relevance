Disturbances of sleep and cognitive functioning in patients with dementia.
The relationship of sleep, circadian rhythms, and cognitive impairment in dementia patients is briefly reviewed. All night sleep EEG data were collected in relatively young and relatively unimpaired patients with presumptive Alzheimer's disease and eight age matched controls. Delta sleep time and Delta sleep % (Stages 3 and 4)  but not REM sleep measures  were significantly reduced in the patients. Implications of these findings are discussed.
