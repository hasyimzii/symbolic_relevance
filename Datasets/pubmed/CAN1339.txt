Exposure to radioiodine in the preconception and conception periods. A case report.
A case of radiation exposure shortly before conception is presented. The patient  refused abortion and was delivered of a healthy infant. On reconsideration of the case, it was decided that the recommendation to terminate the pregnancy on the grounds of excessive exposure to radiation was unjustified. We feel that physicians should be aware that abortion in such cases is not always necessary.
