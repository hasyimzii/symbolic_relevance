Phospholipid composition of inner and outer mitochondrial membranes isolated from Yoshida hepatoma AH 130.
Outer and inner membranes isolated from hepatoma AH 130 and rat liver mitochondria were used to study phospholipid composition. The phosphatidylethanolamine content increased and that of phosphatidylcholine decreased in ;whole mitochondria and isolated membranes. The ratio between the 2 phospholipids increased 47% and 117% in the inner and outer membranes respectively. A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane. In contrast to the results of previous work, no sphingomyelin was found in hepatoma mitochondria and isolated membranes.
