myo Inositol transport in renal brush border vesicles and it inhibition by D glucose.
We examined the mechanism of myo inositol uptake by rabbit renal proximal tubule  brush border membrane vesicles and characterized the relationship between the transports of myo inositol and D glucose. A 100 mM Na+ electrochemical gradient (extravesicular medium > intravesicular medium) stimulated the initial rate of myo inositol uptake 20  to 60 fold. Other cation gradients were ineffective. The Na+ myo inositol co transport system was shown to be electrogenic. The Na+ electrochemical gradient dependent uptake of myo inositol saturated at about 1 mM myo inositol, with an apparent Km of 94 micro M at an initial 100 mM Na+ gradient. D Glucose was an inhibitor of the Na+ gradient dependent uptake of myo inositol. D Glucose, but not L glucose, elicited accelerative exchange diffusion of myo inositol. myo Inositol did not significantly inhibit the Na+ gradient dependent transport of D glucose. We suggest that D glucose inhibits myo inositol uptake by dissipating the membrane potential and sharing the myo inositol carrier. The inhibition of myo inositol transport across the brush border membrane by D glucose explains how glycosuria could produce inosituria in patients with diabetes mellitus.
