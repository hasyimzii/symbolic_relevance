Insulin resistance: definition and treatment.
Two cases of insulin resistance are described, and recent developments in the pathogenesis and treatment of insulin resistance are reviewed. Both immune and nonimmune types of insulin resistance have been described. Immune resistance is related to the presence of circulating antibodies directed against exogenous insulin or the insulin receptor sites. Nonimmune resistance is associated with obesity, ketoacidosis, infection, or endocrinopathies. Treatment of insulin resistant diabetics can include proper diet and weight control; use of insulin in large quantities; selection of less antigenic forms of insulin, such as pork, fish, or sulfated insulin; oral hypoglycemics such as tolbutamide; and immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids. The production of human insulin by recombinant DNA technology promises benefits to patients with high levels of antibodies directed against insulin from animal sources. True insulin resistance is a rare phenomenon, which must be documented adequately before vigorous treatment is considered.
