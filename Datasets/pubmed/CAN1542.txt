Transplacental and neonatal carcinogenesis by 1 butyl 1 nitrosourethan in the ACI/N rat.
1 Butyl 1 nitrosourethan (BNUR) and 1 butylurethane (BUR), a precursor of BNUR, were administered prenatally or neonatally to ACI/N rats. A few neurogenic tumors were induced in the offspring of mother rats that had received BNUR at the late stage of pregnancy and in the animals that had received one subcutaneous injection of BNUR within 24 hr after birth. No neurogenic tumors were observed in rats treated with BUR prenatally or neonatally.
