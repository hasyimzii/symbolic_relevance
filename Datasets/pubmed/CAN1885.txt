Distant metastasis of intensively treated bladder carcinomas.
The successful cure of the local tumour in the urinary bladder with the combination of surgical treatment and hard ray therapy prevents in many patients the development of local complications  uremia and anaemia, which were in former time responsible for dead. The prolongated survival time makes convenient the clinical appearance of the latent metastatic formation of the urinary bladder carcinomas by blood and lymph nodes. Here are shown connections between the local growth of the tumour, histological type, kind and frequency of the metastasis. By means of the diagnosis of such tumour diseases we have the possibility of the opportune use for palliative treatment.
