Occurrence of IgA subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) in the human nervous system. Correlation with disease.
The occurrence of IgA subclasses in pathological conditions of the nervous system was studied by means of monoclonal antibodies and an indirect immunofluorescence technique. IgA1  and/or IgA2 positive lymphoid (plasma) cells were found in demyelinating diseases comprising multiple sclerosis, Guillain Barre syndrome, and adrenoleukodystrophy, in various inflammatory diseases, and in tumors, some of which exhibited labeling of tumor cells. Demyelinating and inflammatory diseases with chronic course displayed some prevalence of IgA2 , and tumors some prevalence of IgA1 positive cells. This is the first demonstration of IgA1 and IgA2 in the nervous system.
