Cross reactivity to human T lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy associated virus and molecular cloning of simian T cell lymphotropic virus type III from African green monkeys.
Simian T lymphotropic retroviruses with structural, antigenic, and cytopathic features similar to the etiologic agent of human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, human T lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy associated virus (HTLV III/LAV), have been isolated from a variety of primate species including African green monkeys (STLV IIIAGM). This report describes nucleic acid cross reactivity between STLV IIIAGM and HTLV III/LAV, molecular cloning of the STLV IIIAGM genome, and evaluation of its structure and genetic relationship to other retroviruses. Overlapping clones from a cell line infected with virus from a single animal were found to encompass the entire STLV IIIAGM genome and exhibit a limited degree of restriction site variability. Specific hybridizing fragments were detected in DNA from this and other STLV IIIAGM infected cell lines. A fraction of viral DNA present in at least two STLV IIIAGM lines persists as unintegrated viral DNA, a characteristic of infection with cytopathic retroviruses. Strongest cross reactivity was detected between HTLV III/LAV pol  and gag  genes and STLV IIIAGM, whereas no cross reactivity was detected between STLV IIIAGM and molecular clones of human T lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV I and  II), visna virus, bovine leukemia virus, or feline leukemia virus.
