Synaptic density in chronic animals with experimental neurofibrillary changes.
Synaptic density was quantitated in the cerebral cortex and subiculum of rabbits  with experimental neurofibrillary changes. Animals were subjected to subcutaneous injection of aluminum tartrate for 90 days, and synapses stained with ethanolic phosphotungstic acid were analyzed in animals killed 100, 200, or 300 days postinjection with aluminum tartrate. A significant difference was found in synaptic density between animals injected with aluminum tartrate and their age matched controls. This difference was a result of a low synaptic density present in animals killed 200 or 300 days postinjection of aluminum tartrate. In contrast, animals killed 100 days postinjection revealed the same synaptic density as their control. The data suggest that the synaptic depopulation associated with experimental neurofibrillary changes is a gradual process, and such changes are demonstrable only long after the initial appearance of neurofibrillary changes.
