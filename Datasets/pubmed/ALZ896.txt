Association of autoimmune dementia, Basedow's disease, and Gougerot Sjogren syndrome.
The authors observed one case of myoclonic dementia reversible with steroid therapy, associated with Grave's disease and Sjogren's syndrome. A circulating IgG fraction was demonstrated reacting specifically with cerebral micro vessels and which evolved in parallel with the neuro psychiatric disturbances. These results support the hypothesis of an autoimmune vasculitis causing the dementia. The persistence of abnormalities one year after clinical cure showing an alteration of the blood brain barrier associated with the appearance of circulating antibodies against the hypophyseal cells, and in view of the predictive value of these antibodies, suggests a possibility of the eventual apparition of an Alzheimer type dementia.
