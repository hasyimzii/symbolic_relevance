Multiple basaloma and meningioma following long term arsenic therapy.
A case of multiple basal cell carcinomas and a meningioma after long term arsenic ingestion is reported. A relationship between arsenic intake and basal cell carcinomas is well known, whereas a meningioma associated with arsenic therapy has not been reported yet. Results of experimental tumor research could suggest a connection between arsenic intake and the development of a meningioma.
