The effects of treatment with insulin on serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol in rats with streptozotocin induced diabetes.
1. No significant difference in serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol  was observed when control rats were compared with rats with streptozotocin induced diabetes of 14 days duration. Blood glucose and serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher in the diabetic group. 2. In a second experiment rats with streptozotocin induced diabetes of 8 days duration were given long acting porcine insulin (1 unit/day or 3 units/day subcutaneously for 14 days) and were compared with a control group. Blood glucose and serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations did not differ significantly with the two doses of insulin and there was no significant difference between serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol in control rats and either of the two groups of rats given insulin. 3. When the rats given insulin were grouped according to their blood glucose concentrations, those with blood glucose in the range 20 30 mmol/l were found to have significantly higher serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations than those with higher or lower blood glucose levels or than controls. There was thus a statistically significant curvilinear relationship between blood glucose and serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations.
