Urinary excretion of beta hexosaminidase in different forms of proteinuria.
The urinary excretion of beta hexosaminidase was studied in different forms of proteinuria. Patients with tubular proteinuria showed a very large increase in beta hexosaminidase only in the acute stage of the renal disease, while patients with chronic tubular dysfunction did not show any greater degree of beta hexosaminidase excretion. The same findings were noted in glomerular disease, in which patients with a very high degree of disease activity showed a marked increase in enzyme excretion. There was a good correlation between enzyme excretion and level of proteinuria. In Bence Jones proteinuria it seems possible to determine the grade of renal injury caused by the light chain.
