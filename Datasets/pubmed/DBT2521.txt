Optometric management of the diabetic patient: Part II  Treatment and office control of the diabetic patient.
Proper management of the diabetic patient and effective communication with other  health care providers requires that the optometrist have a sound working knowledge of the accepted standards of total diabetic care. Treatment of type 1 diabetes usually requires insulin and a proper diet. Type 2 diabetes often will respond to a rigid diet alone, but may require insulin or oral antidiabetic medications. Finally, patient education is the backbone of all treatment and must be reinforced by all health care providers at each office visit.
