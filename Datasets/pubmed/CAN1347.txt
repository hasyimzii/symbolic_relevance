Serum gastrin response to secretin after vagotomy.
It is unknown whether the gastrin response to secretin (secretin test) can distinguish hypergastrinemia due to vagotomy from hypergastrinemia due to Zollinger Ellison syndrome (ZES). Therefore, we measured serum gastrin concentrations basally and in response to intravenous secretin in 13 vagotomized duodenal ulcer patients without preoperative evidence evidence of ZES and in 5 vagotomized patients with ZES. Following secretin, serum gastrin concentrations increased 40 pg/ml or less [mean (+/  SE) rise 23 +/  3 pg/ml] in the vagotomized patients without ZES. On the other hand, in the patients with ZES serum gastrin increments after secretin ranged from 105 to 1224 pg/ml. Thus, a large (> 100 pg/ml) rise in serum gastrin concentrations following secretin in a vagotomized patient should suggest Zollinger Ellison syndrome and not be attributed to vagotomy per se.
