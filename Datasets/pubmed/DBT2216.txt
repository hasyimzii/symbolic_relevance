Impairment of insulin secretion in man by nifedipine.
The effect of nifedipine, a calcium antagonist, on carbohydrate metabolism and insulin secretion was evaluated in patients who required treatment with this drug. 20 subjects underwent two oral glucose tolerance tests (100 g), one under basal conditions, and the other after ten days of treatment with nifedipine 30 mg/day by mouth, in three divided doses. 10 subjects had normal glucose tolerance; in them nifedipine administration reduced the insulin response to oral glucose in the first 60 min, but improved glucose tolerance. The other 10 subjects had impaired glucose tolerance and nifedipine treatment resulted in a further reduction both of insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. No such effects were seen in the placebo (weight  and disease matched) group. The mechanism by which nifedipine influences carbohydrate metabolism and insulin secretion is discussed.
