Bilateral cysts of the jaw occurring with multiple skin lesions.
As jaw cysts are frequently the initial manifestations of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, dentists have the opportunity to detect this disease early, before the patients seek medical treatment for the condition. Diagnosis of the syndrome should be considered in the case of any young patient with odontogenic keratocysts and there should be extensive followup to give early warning of the development of nevoid basal cell carcinomas.
