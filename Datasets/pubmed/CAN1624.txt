Value of the prone position in detecting pulmonary nodules by computed tomography.
Computed tomography of the lungs is usually performed in the supine position. The prone position may add important information by countering the effects of gravity on pulmonary vascularity. In addition, better expansion of the posterior lung fields may be achieved in the prone position than possible when the patient lies supine. Three cases are presented in which the prone scan provided significant additional diagnostic information affecting interpretation.
