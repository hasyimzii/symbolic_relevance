Course of pulmonary involvement in patients with Hodgkin's disease.
65 patients with Hodgkin's disease and pulmonary involvement were observed during the fifteen years from 1964 to 1978. Polychemotherapy was administered to 24 patients and monochemotherapy to 28. Six of the 24 patients on polychemotherapy reached the four year limit after diagnosis of pulmonary involvement. The results in the patients on monochemotherapy were significantly worse. None of the male patients lived longer than 28 months. None of the patients with mixed cellularity and lymphocyte depleted histology had a survival of more than one year after diagnosis of the pulmonary involvement.
