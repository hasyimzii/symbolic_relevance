Oncocytomas (oxyphil adenomas) of the lacrimal caruncle.
Three cases of oncocytoma (oxyphil adenoma) of the lacrimal caruncle are reported. Transmission electron microscopy performed on one of the lesions confirms the tumour to be composed of cells containing abnormally large numbers of mitochondria. It is suggested that these tumours arise from accessory lacrimal glands or their secretory ducts.
