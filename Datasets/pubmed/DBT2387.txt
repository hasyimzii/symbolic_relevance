Demonstration of sugar and determination of the secretor status from urine stains of diabetics.
In this preliminary study urine an saliva samples have been typed for the presence of ABH Blood Group specific substances from fresh samples and the stains prepared therefrom. Fresh samples have been typed by the Absorption Inhibition and the stains by the Absorption Elution Technique. 42 of saliva and 37 of the urine samples (fresh) have been found to be secretors, while from the stains 36 (= 72 Prozent) and 32 (= 64 Prozent) samples would be typed correctly from saliva and urine stains. The Benedict's Test for sugar has been found to be positive in 35 of the fresh urine samples where as from stains 31 (= 62 Prozent) could be typed correctly. On the basis of the above study the following conclusions emerge out. 1. Benedict's Test for sugar may be conveniently used in the field of Forensic Science for analysing urine stains in order to exclude persons not actually involved in a crime. 2. Persons who secret ABH Substances in saliva may not in all cases secrete them in urine.
