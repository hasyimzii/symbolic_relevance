Continuous recording of plasma glucose level after glucose tolerance and 3 different breakfast. Search for a normal post prandial plasma glucose (author's transl).
We have studied glucose tolerance test (GTT) and glucose after 3 different breakfast (50, 100, 150 g CHO), in order to define a postprandial glucose level for the detection and control of diabetes mellitus. If the breakfast is sufficient enough (100 or 150 g CHO) the response after breakfast is similar to GTT. The post meal glucose is < 1,5 g/L mean + 2 SD) at 35 mn and < 0,97 g/L at 108 mn. Glucose level over these limits set to search a diabetes. Nevertheless this study is restricted by two points: the subjects are young and the load must be sufficient enough (over 100 g CHO).
