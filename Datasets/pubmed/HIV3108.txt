Experimental inoculation of monkeys with autologous lymphoid cell lines immortalized by and producing human T cell leukemia virus type I.
Cynomolgus monkeys and squirrel monkeys were inoculated with autologous lymphoid  cell lines immortalized by and producing human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV I) in order to serve as an animal model of adult T cell leukemia (ATL). The autologous cell lines were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from each monkey by co cultivation with lethally irradiated MT 2 cells producing HTLV I. All of these cell lines, which had monkey karyotypes, grew continuously without addition of interleukin 2 (IL 2) and expressed virus specific proteins of HTLV I and IL 2 receptor. After inoculation with the autologous cell lines, specific antibodies against HTLV I proteins could be detected in their plasma, and transformed HTLV I infected cells could be recovered from their peripheral blood for at least 6 months. However, no signs of ATL have been observed to data, i.e. 2 years after inoculation.
