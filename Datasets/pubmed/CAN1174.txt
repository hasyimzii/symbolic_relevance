Structural comparison of human, bovine, rat, and Walker 256 carcinosarcoma asparaginyl tRNA.
The complete nucleotide sequences of human placenta, human liver, and bovine liver tRNAAsn have been determined. A comparison of these tRNA structures with the previously reported nucleotide sequences of rat liver and Walker 256 carcinosarcoma tRNAAns reveals that the primary nucleotide sequences of the major species of mammalian cytoplasmic tRNAasn are conserved in higher eucaryotes. The complete nucleotide sequence of these tRNAs is: pG U C U C U G U m1G m2G C G C A A D C G G D X A G C G C m2(2)G psi psi C G G C U  Q(G) U U t6A A C C G A A A G m7G D U G G U G G Z psi C G m1A G C C C A C C C A G  G G A C G C C AOH where X is 3 (3 amino 3 carboxyl n propyl)uridine, Q is 7 (4,5 cis dihydroxyl 1 cyclopenten 3 yl aminomethyl) 7 deazaguanosine, Z is an unknown modified nucleotide, and Q(G) represents the replacement of Q nucleoside by G nucleoside in Walker 256 carcinosarcoma tRNAAsn. These primary structures were determined by combined use of the 3H  and 32P post labeling techniques. Sequences were compared by tritium nucleoside trialcohol analysis, completed RNAase T1 digestion followed by 3H labeled fingerprinting on polyethylenimine impregnated cellulose by two dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC), and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of either 5' 32P  and/or 3' [32P]pCp labeled tRNA after partial ribonuclease digestions.
