Comparison of sex steroid receptor analyses and carcinoembryonic antigen with clinical response to hormone therapy.
This study corroborates previous reports which suggested the efficacy of estrogen receptor (ER) analysis in predicting responses of patients with metastatic mammary carcinoma to hormonal therapeutic manipulation. The predictive value of multiconcentration titration and sucrose density gradient analyses of ERs and progesterone receptors (PRs) are compared. The predictive value of ER analyses can be improved by the discrimination of 8S versus 4S binding species or by the use of PR analysis in combination with ER analysis. The tumor associated antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), is evolving as an important quantitative aid in evaluating the clinical responses to patients receiving hormonal therapy.
