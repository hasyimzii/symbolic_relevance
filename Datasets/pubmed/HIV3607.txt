Recombinant human interferon beta suppresses the replication of HIV and acts synergistically with AZT.
The in vitro effects of recombinant human interferon beta ser (rIFN beta ser) and 3' azido 3' deoxythymidine (AZT) alone and in combination on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication were examined. rIFN beta ser inhibited HIV progeny virus synthesis in cell cultures chronically infected with HIV. When used in combination, suboptimally effective concentrations of rIFN beta ser and AZT synergistically inhibited HIV mediated syncytium formation in HeLa T4 cell cultures. Whereas AZT alone reduced HIV replication in human MT 2 cells, addition of low concentrations of rIFN beta ser reduced by 4  to 1,000 fold the amount of AZT required to maximally block HIV p24 antigen synthesis and HIV mediated cell lysis. No drug related cytoxicity was observed when the two agents were used together at and above maximally effective concentrations. These results suggest that a safer, yet effective, therapy for HIV infections may be achieved with reduced doses of AZT in combination with rIFN beta ser.
