Fatality of purulent meningitis in adults 1950 to 1985. Retrospective study of the case histories of 391 patients of the Cologne Neurologic University Clinic.
Although intensive care medicine and chemotherapy of bacterial infections have made great progress during the last 30 years, therapeutic efficacy in bacterial meningitis in adult patients could not be improved. Retrospective analysis of 391 cases of adult bacterial meningitis between 1950 and 1985 shows no significant changes in etiology and only slight reduction in mortality. The course of the disease depends mostly on age, state of consciousness and CSF cell count. Cases of meningitis in HIV patients and cerebral tuberculosis have not been evaluated in this study.
