Gene organization of the transforming region of weakly oncogenic adenovirus type  7: the E1a region.
The structures of adenovirus type 7 (Ad7) cytoplasmic RNAs transcribed from the leftmost 4.5% of the viral genome during lytic infection of KB cells have been determined. The E1a region was found to specify three differently spliced mRNAs (I, II and III) which have common 5' and 3' termini. mRNAs I and II are transcribed between identical initiation and termination codons and code for polypeptides of 28 kd and 24 kd, whose only difference is an internal sequence of 32 amino acids present in the 28 kd protein. Translation of mRNA III initiates at the same AUG codon as in mRNA I and II, but uses a different reading frame beyond the splice point; consequently, it terminates at an earlier stop codon and yields a 6.3 kd polypeptide. Cytoplasmic E1a RNA was used as a template for in vitro protein synthesis in a cell free system and found to encode polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 42 kd, 40 kd, and 11 kd.
