Urine C peptide, beta cell function, and insulin requirement.
Urinary C peptide excretion was investigated as a method for monitoring beta cell function in diabetic patients and for studying the contribution of endogenous insulin production to diabetic control. Control subjects had variations in serum and urine C peptide immunoreactivity that correlated with basal and meal related insulin secretion. In a group of well controlled juvenile diabetic patients, those receiving high doses of insulin had low or negligible C peptide excretion, whereas most patients with low exogenous insulin requirements had near normal urinary C peptide excretion. Patients treated for diabetic ketoacidosis had recovery of beta cell function as measured by C peptide immunoreactivity in serial urine specimens. Thus, measurement of urinary C peptide excretion is a simple technique that may be useful in assessing endogenous insulin production in juvenile diabetic patients.
