Transurethral and transrectal ultrasonic scanning in urology.
An ultrasonic scanner is described that can be used for transurethral as well as  for transrectal scanning of the bladder, the prostate and the seminal vesicles. Transurethral scanning is performed as an integral part of a cystoscopy procedure, with a small rotating transducer through the cystoscope. Transrectal scanning is done with a larger transducer inside a water filled balloon inserted into the rectum. We examined 200 patients with the scanner. The bladder was visualized best by the transurethral scanning, while the rectal approach was preferable for examination of the prostate and the seminal vesicles. The method has proved especially useful in staging bladder tumors and prostatic cancer, in estimating prostatic size and in detecting pathology, such as abscesses in the prostate and the seminal vesicles.
