A fluoroquinolone (DR 3355) protects human lymphocyte cell lines from HIV 1 induced cytotoxicity.
HIV 1 infection of human CD4+ lymphocyte cell lines results in cell death. Treatment, but not pretreatment, of infected cells, with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, DR 3355, protects a significant subfraction of cells from HIV 1 mediated cytolysis. All surviving cells have lost expression of the CD4 antigen, but do (MT 4) or do not (CEM) express viral antigens and produce infective virus. The rescued CEM and MT 4 cells are phenotypically stable and do not require continuous exposure to the drug for survival.
