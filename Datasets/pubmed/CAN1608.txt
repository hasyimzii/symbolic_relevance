Convulsions with meningiomas: incidence and significance.
In a study of a consecutive series of 127 surgically treated meningiomas, it was  found that 29% of the patients had reported with convulsions as their initial symptom. In this group, surgical excision of the meningioma stopped the convulsions in about half of the patients, but the others continued to have seizures after their operations. Among those patients with meningiomas who did not have preoperative convulsions, about one sixth (15 patients) developed postoperative seizures. Patients in both groups required prolonged anticonvulsant medication. Factors predisposing to the occurrence of postoperative seizures were the site of the tumor, faulty surgical technique, and a preoperative history of seizures.
