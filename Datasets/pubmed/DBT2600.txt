You and the U 100 changeover.
Between 10% and 58% of diabetics are injecting insulin in doses which are unrelated to their stated doses. Some are injecting five times as much as they and their medical advisers believe they do. At least 6000 Australian diabetics will experience gross dosage changes with the introduction of U 100 insulin unless the members of the medical profession become aware of the problem. Recognition and correction of the problem are discussed.
