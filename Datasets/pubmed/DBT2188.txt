Glycosylated hemoglobins in Friedreich's ataxia.
In a study of glycosylated hemoglobins in Friedreich's Ataxia patients and in family members, the level was found to be higher in insulin dependent diabetics than in healthy non diabetic control subjects (p < 0.01), but was similar to non ataxic diabetic control subjects. Results for non diabetic Friedreich's Ataxia patients and siblings were similar to those for non diabetic control subjects while levels were slightly increased in the heterozygotes. It is concluded that in Friedreich's Ataxia patients and family members (apart from the insulin dependent diabetics), there was no hyperglycemia sufficient to be detected as an increase in glycosylated hemoglobins.
