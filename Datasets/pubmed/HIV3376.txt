Enzyme abnormalities of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
We determined the enzyme activities of glucose 6 phosphate isomerase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase in serum from 23 normal controls, 27 anti HIV seropositive individuals confirmed by Western blot, and 53 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There is a significant difference for all four enzyme activities among controls, HIV seropositive individuals, and patients with AIDS, the enzyme activities showing a progressive increase as the disease progresses. Evidently these enzyme measurements may be adjunctive biochemical markers for progression of AIDS.
