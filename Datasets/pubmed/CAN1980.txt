Reversible growth arrest in simian virus 40 transformed human fibroblasts.
A reversible growth arrest of simian virus 40 transformed human fibroblasts has been produced by replacement of methionine in the growth medium by its immediate metabolic precursor, homocysteine, Although these arrested cells exhibit a greatly reduced cloning efficiency when plated in methionine supplemented medium, they resume rapid proliferation without a lag when subconfluent cells are refed with methionine supplemented medium. This growth arrest is accompanied by a reduction in the percentage of mitotic cells in the cell population. Furthermore, data obtained using fluorescence activated cell sorting techniques indicate that the cells are arrested i the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. This is in contrast to a G1 phase accumulation of cells, which occurs only in methionine supplemented medium at very high densities and which is similar to the G1 block seen in cultures of normal fibroblasts at high density. The apparent relationship between specific events in the DNA synthetic and premitotic phase of the cell cycle and methionine dependence in these transformed cultures is discussed.
