Dependence of gastro intestinal tumors on gastro intestinal hormones: pentagastrin stimulates growth of transplanted colon adenocarcinoma in mice.
Gastrin was administered several times to mice with transplantable hepatoma, sarcomas, colon adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma of small intestine. Injections of gastrin stimulated the growth of colon adenocarcinoma in mice but not of the other tumors tested. Dependence upon gastro intestinal hormones of "spontaneous" carcinogenesis in gastro intestinal tract and the growth of many gastro intestinal pancreatic and liver tumors is suggested. This hormone dependence could be used for the treatment and prophylaxis of some tumors of the gastro intestinal tract.
