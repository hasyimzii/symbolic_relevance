An immunohistochemical study on cerebral vascular and senile plaque amyloid in Alzheimer's dementia.
Senile cerebral amyloidosis has been investigated using immunoperoxidase and enzyme histochemical techniques in six unfixed brains. Our findings do not support the opinion that vascular and senile plaque amyloid are immunoglobulin derived. In contrast with recent reports we did not detect prealbumin in senile plaques and congophilic angiopathy lesions. All senile plaques contain complement factors C1q, C3 and C4. The highest peroxidase activity was found in the amyloid nucleus but the corona also showed evident peroxidase activity.
