Biochemical and biologic characterization of lymphocyte regulatory molecules. III. The isolation and phenotypic characterization of Interleukin 2 producing T cell lymphomas.
To isolate a stable tumor cell line source of Interleukin 2 (IL 2 formerly referred to as T cell growth factor), over 40 murine leukemia and lymphoma cells as well as 9 clonal helper and killer IL 2 driven T cell lines were screened for both constitutive and mitogen stimulated IL 2 production. A radiation induced splenic lymphoma from the B10.BR mouse, the LBRM 33 cell line, could be stimulated to produce over 1000 units/ml of IL 2 after 24 hr exposure to T cell mitogens. Peak IL 2 activity was found in supernatants harvested from 24 hr cultures of either 1% PHA or 20 micrograms/ml Con A stimulated LBRM 33 cells (10(6) cells/ml). IL 2 production observed in both serum free and serum containing cultures represented between 1000 and 5000 times the quantity of IL 2 produced in conventional cultures of mitogen activated rat or mouse spleen cells. Peak IL 2 production by LBRM 33 cultures (stimulated at either optimal Con A or PHA concentrations or co stimulated with suboptimal amounts of mitogen and phorbol myristate acetate) was consistently accompanied by LBRM 33 cell death. Phenotypic characterization of the producer cell revealed LBRM 33 cells to be Thy 1+, Ly 1+, Ly 2+, Ly 3+, Qa 2 3+, Qa 3.2+, Qat 4+, and Ly 5+. These studies provide further evidence that IL 2 is a T cell product and establish a source of IL 2 that will be a valuable reagent for the isolation and further molecular characterization of this immunoregulatory molecule.
