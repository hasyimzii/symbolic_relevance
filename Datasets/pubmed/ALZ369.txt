Neurotoxicity of certain environmental substances.
Lead, aluminum, mercury, and ketones and related solvents are discussed because they represent common problems in the environment and because they demonstrate selective vulnerability, selectively attacking some portions of the nervous system, sparing others. The absorption, excretion, distribution, and toxicologic effects of these chemicals and the diseases they are associated with are reviewed, as is the accuracy of screening procedures for detection of these chemicals.
