Home glucose monitoring for insulin dependent diabetics: preliminary results.
Home glucose monitoring is one of several new and aggressive approaches to improving blood glucose homeostasis in the insulin deficient diabetic. The advent of a successful long term pancreatic transplant or a reliable miniaturized artificial pancreas may, soon, supercede it as a treatment modality, but for the time it would appear that home glucose monitoring is a viable alternative to the more conventional and less successful methods of control and should at least be considered for use in patients with insulin deficient diabetes mellitus.
