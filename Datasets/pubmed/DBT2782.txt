Glucose disappearance in infants of diabetic mothers. III. Relationship of spontaneous glucose disappearance to glucose tolerance, neonatal hypoglycemia and lowest blood glucose.
Spontaneous glucose disappearance in the first 90 min of life and glucose disappearance following an intravenous injection of 1 g/kg dextrose were measured in 23 infants of insulin dependent diabetic mothers. Spontaneous disappearance was log linear in 12/23 infants, providing for calculation of an endogenous Kt which correlated significantly (P < 0.01) with the exogenous Kt determined after the dextrose injection, r = 0.74. Hypoglycemia < 20 mg/dl occurred in 4/23 infants, and was identified during the spontaneous glucose disappearance (3 infants) and/or predicted by an endogenous Kt greater than or equal to 3.0%/min (2 infants). There was also a significant inverse correlation (P < 0.01) of the lowest blood glucose obtained within the first 24 h of life with the endogenous Kt, r = 0.61. There was no correlation of the endogenous or exogenous Kt, lowest blood glucose or hypoglycemia with White's classification of the maternal diabetes, diabetic control during pregnancy, the maternal blood glucose at delivery or the cord blood glucose. These data indicate that determination of spontaneous glucose disappearance within the first 90 min of life is useful in identifying infants of diabetic mothers with hypoglycemia or those who will subsequently develop hypoglycemia.
