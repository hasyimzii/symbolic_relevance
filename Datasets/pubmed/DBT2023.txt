Amyloidosis and diabetes in humans.
The relationship between amyloidosis and diabetes mellitus has been investigated  with special regard to the islets of Langerhans. Little information is available in the literature about the relationship between diabetes mellitus and extrainsular amyloidosis. New data on the nature of amyloid and particularly its separation into two groups called "APUD " and "Immunoamyloid" has induced us to reconsider the whole problem. The aim of this review is a reconstruction of the problem also on the basis of our experience.
