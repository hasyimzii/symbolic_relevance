Norepinephrine and MH
Postmortem findings of decreased brain norepinephrine (NE) content and decreased  locus ceruleus neuronal density have suggested a possible noradrenergic deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assessed CNS and peripheral noradrenergic function in patients with advanced AD, moderate AD, and age matched normals by measuring NE and the NE metabolite 3 methoxy 4 hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) levels in CSF and plasma. Subjects were drug free for at least two weeks. Plasma and CSF NE and MHPG levels were significantly higher in patients with advanced AD than in
