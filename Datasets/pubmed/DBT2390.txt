Motor conduction velocity (MCV) in insulin dependent and non insulin dependent diabetics with and without clinical peripheral neuropathy.
Motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) was determined in the external sciatic popliteus nerve in 83 subjects (46 males and 37 females), 33 with insulin dependent and 50 with noninsulin dependent diabetes, with or without clinical signs of diabetic neuropathy. Duration of known diabetes ranged from one month to 32 years. No difference was observed in MCV between insulin dependent and non insulin dependent diabetics. MCV was inversely correlated (p < 0,05) with age, but not with the duration of the disease or with metabolic control. Duration and metabolic control were related to the appearance of clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy.
