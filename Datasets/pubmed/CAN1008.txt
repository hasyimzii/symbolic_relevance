Cell proliferation kinetics of the intramuscularly implanted Lewis lung carcinoma.
The growth kinetics of the Lewis lung carcinoma tumor was studied. The main proliferative parameters of an early stage of the growth (8th day after tumor implantation) were derived from the analysis of the growth curve and the fraction of labeled mitoses (FLM curve). The occurrence of proliferative changes due to the transplantation was confirmed. The main variations observed concern a shortening of the cell cycle time, a prolongation of the S phase duration and an increase in cell loss. A critical analysis of the results of this preliminary study is reported.
