Age dependence of vascular prostacyclin formation in man (author's transl).
The synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI2), the most potent known inhibitor of platelet aggregation, varies with age. After 30 years the production decreases, but increases again in the 6th and 7th decade. Contrary to these physiological variations patients suffering from juvenile onset diabetes or peripheral angiopathy show a markedly decreased prostacyclin synthesis. Since the prostacyclin system in thought to be an important blood vessel protector, the pathological low level of PGI2 synthesis could be a key position in development or progression of vascular complications.
