Cholinesterase enzymes in the blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Plasma pseudocholinesterase activity was about 100% higher in patients with Alzheimer's type dementia than in similar age controls. Red cell acetylcholinesterase activity tended to be lower in patients than controls. Administration of lecithin substantially increased plasma choline levels but did not alter activity of either of the cholinesterase enzymes.
