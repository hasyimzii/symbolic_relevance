HPV 16 positive bowenoid papulosis and squamous cell carcinoma of the anus in an  HIV positive man.
A homosexual man in stage IV of HIV infection, who suffers from HPV 16 positive bowenoid papulosis of the anal region, is described. In one area the patient developed an HPV 16 positive squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. Bowenoid papulosis represents a squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and usually follows a benign clinical course. The possibility exists that immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk to develop cancer on the basis of bowenoid papulosis.
