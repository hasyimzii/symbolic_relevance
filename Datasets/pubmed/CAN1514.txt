Tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenitis presenting as chest wall mass.
Tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenitis is an unusual presentation of primary tuberculosis in adults. In the case reported here, the mediastinal focus was initially obscured by a large chest wall mass that communicated with it. This combination of findings, which we believe to be reported first here, underscores the need to consider tuberculosis in differential diagnosis of mediastinal and chest wall masses.
