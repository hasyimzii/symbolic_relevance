Different sites of interaction for Rev, Tev, and Rex proteins within the Rev responsive element of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
We have analyzed the action of the Rev and Tev proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) and of the Rex protein of human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV I) on a series of Rev responsive element (RRE) mutants. The minimum continuous RRE region necessary and sufficient for Rev function was determined to be 204 nucleotides. Interestingly, this region was not sufficient for Tev or Rex function. These proteins require additional sequences, which may stabilize the structure of the RRE or may contain additional sequence specific elements. Internal RRE deletions revealed that the targets for Rev and Rex can be separated, since mutants responding to Rev and not Rex and vice versa were identified. Tev was active on both types of mutants, suggesting that it has a more relaxed specificity than do both Rev and Rex proteins. Although Rev and Rex targets within the RRE appear to be distinct, the trans dominant mutant RevBL prevents the RRE interaction with Rex. RevBL cannot inhibit the function of Rex on RRE deletions that lack the Rev responsive portion. These results indicate the presence of distinct sites within the RRE for interaction with these proteins. The binding sites for the different proteins do not function independently and may interfere with one another. Mutations affecting the RRE may change the accessibility and binding characteristics of the different binding sites.
