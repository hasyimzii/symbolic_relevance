Contraception for the insulin dependent diabetic woman: the view from one clinic.
Experience in a large diabetic clinic has confirmed the suspicion that insulin dependent diabetic women are at considerably increased risk of thromboembolic disease if they take combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive preparations. The most obvious alternative, an intrauterine device, is associated with an unexpectedly high failure rate, probably because of an unusual metabolic interaction with the diabetic endometrium. In a small group of diabetic women the progestogen only pill was found to be a successful form of contraception not associated with any side effects except for menstrual irregularities. For most diabetic women the choice of contraceptive should therefore be between a progestogen only pill and a mechanical method. Female sterilization and injectable progesterone each have their place in particular circumstances. Careful counseling of each patient is essential to ensure the best choice of contraceptive and correct application of the chosen method.
