Immunopathogenesis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
Many abnormalities of humoral and cellular immunity associated with the acquired  immunodeficiency syndrome can be explained by the preferential infection of the T4 lymphocyte subset with the etiologic retrovirus. Severe alterations in specific T4 functions, such as inadequate immune responsiveness to specific antigen, result in devastating morbidity and mortality. On the basis of accumulated scientific knowledge, we outline the immunopathogenesis of this syndrome.
