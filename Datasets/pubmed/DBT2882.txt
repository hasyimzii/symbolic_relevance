The acute effects of streptozotocin induced diabetes on rat liver glycerolipid biosynthesis.
Streptozotocin induced diabetes produced a significant rise in rat serum and liver triacylglycerol content and hepatic triacylglycerol biosynthesis measured in vivo. Microsomes, isolated from the livers of streptozotocin exposed animals (2 72h), exhibited an increased capacity to incorporate sn [1,3 (14)C]glycerol 3 phosphate into neutral lipid (diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol) in the presence of ATP, CoA and palmitate. The streptozotocin induced elevation of microsomal neutral lipid production was accompanied by a corresponding rise in the activity of microsomal phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (4 fold after 72 h of streptozotocin exposure). Diabetic dependent increases in acylglycerol formation, phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity and serum triacylglycerol and fatty acid levels were reversed by administering insulin (10 units protamine zinc/kg) at 16 h intervals (three separate doses( beginning 24 h after streptozotocin exposure. However, the diabetic related rise in hepatic triacylglycerol content was only partially corrected by insulin administration. Streptozotocin relate increases in liver triacylglycerol biosynthesis and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity we associated with alterations in plasma factors, since homogenates of hepatocyte monolayers exposed (18h) to plasma isolated from diabetic (72 h exposure to streptozotocin) animals exhibit an increased capacity to incorporate sn [1,3 (14)C]glycerol 3 phosphate into triacylglycerol compared to homogenates of cells exposed to plasma from control (non fasted) animals. The importance of these plasma factors in altering hepatic acylglycerol formation was also supported by the observation that hepatocyte monolayers exposed to a mixture of plasma isolated from normal (non fasted) animals and plasma components elevated in diabetes (glucagon, glucose, oleate and ketones) showed increases in triacylglycerol formation which were similar to those produced by exposure to diabetic plasma. Additional studies demonstrated that fatty acids (oleate) appeared to be the agent primarily responsible for the diabetic plasma induced rise in monolayer triacylglycerol biosynthesis and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity.
