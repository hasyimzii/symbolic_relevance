Ewing's tumor metastatic to the clivus, simulating meningitis: case report.
Ewing's sarcoma, which is regarded as one of the most lethal primary bone tumors, lies in the domain of the orthopedic surgeon because it occurs most commonly in the shaft of the long bones, especially in the lower extremities. Pain, leukocytosis, fever, anemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are commonly seen. We are presenting a case of Ewing's sarcoma of the left greater trochanter with metastasis to the clivus producing a bilateral 6th nerve palsy. The presence of fever, nuchal rigidity, and photophobia simulated meningitis. The rapid evolution of radiological signs will be discussed.
