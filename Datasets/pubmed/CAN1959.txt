Laparoscopic follow up of patients with ovarian carcinoma.
Laparoscopy with cytology of ascitic fluid or peritoneal washings was performed on 110 occasions in 62 patients with ovarian cancer to assess response to chemotherapy. Damage to bowel occurred on three occasions and complete visualisation of the peritoneal cavity was not possible in 14 patients. When tumour was seen and/or cytology was positive, the prognosis was poor; absence of macroscopic tumour with negative cytology did not preclude continuing disease. A group of patients was identified in whom a change of therapy based on laparoscopic findings after six months of treatment, might have proven beneficial. Laparoscopy has a limited place as a second look procedure in patients undergoing treatment for carcinoma of the ovary.
