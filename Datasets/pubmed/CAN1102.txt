Results of re irradiation for cerebral metastases.
After an initial course of radiation, 56 patients with cerebral metastases had their brain retreated at least once for recurrent neurologic symptoms. The most common primary was from either the lung or breast. The frequent symptoms were headache, weakness, seizures, visual problems, and/or mental changes. Forty two (75%) of these patients responded to the second course of treatment. The median duration of response was 10 weeks and median survival was 14 weeks.
