Correlation of liver tumor morphology and weight to incidence of pulmonary metastases in the mouse.
Benzidine dihydrochloride administered in water at 0, 30, 60, 120, 200 or 400 ppm to 1664 mice induced a total of 368 hepatocellular carcinomas, of which 34 or 9.2% metastasized to the lungs. Liver tumors which were larger and heavier were more prone to metastasize and all that metastasized contained areas of prominent trabecular formation.
