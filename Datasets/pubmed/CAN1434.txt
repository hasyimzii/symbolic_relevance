Apparent mitochondrial creatine kinase in the serum of a patient with metastatic  cancer to the liver.
Creatine kinase (CK, EC 2.7.3.2) activity in the serum of a patient with metastatic carcinoma migrated as two distinct bands cathodal to the origin and to CK 3 on agarose gel electrophoresis. The more cathodal isoenzyme (CKm 2) is of high molecular mass, is precipitated by ammonium sulfate at 30% of saturation, and is not retarded by Sephadex G 100. Treatment with urea at a concentration of 6 mol/L caused CKm 2 to elute with proteins of lower molecular mass on a G 100 column and shifted the electrophoretic migration to a position just cathodal to the origin (CKm 1). Antibody to CK 1 and CK 2 did not affect the activity of either CKm 1 or CKm 2. Similarities between these cathodal bands of CK activity and mitochondrial CK suggest the mitochondrial origin of these isoenzymes. These cathodal CK isoenzymes reacted unpredictably with different commercial reagent systems for determination of CK activity in serum or in agarose gel.
