Family support groups within a research project on dementia.
This is a report of three different support groups for caregivers of patients with senile dementia who were participating in a larger study of Alzheimer disease. One group consisted of structural, open ended sessions while the other two were closed, time limited groups. For this sample the most cohesive and supportive group was one which was unstructured and time limited. It also consisted of caregivers whose relationships to the patients were similar (i.e., spouses). Recommendations for research and practice are made.
