Neuropathology of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Analysis of 22 Brazilian cases.
The neuropathologic study of 22 Brazilian cases of acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was performed. Thirteen cases (59%) showed neuropathologic lesions. These included infection by Toxoplasma (n = 4), Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 3), viral encephalitis (n = 4), primary lymphomas (n = 2), isolated cerebral infarct (n = 1), and reactive gliosis (n = 1). In 2 cases, primary lymphoma and viral encephalitis were associated. Axonal spheroids in the gracilis and cuneatus nuclei were present in a case of toxoplasmosis. Mammillary bodies lesions consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy were found in a case of viral encephalitis. In addition, circulatory changes (focal cortical infarcts) were associated lesions in 3 cases. These findings were compared with the main series reported in American and European literature.
