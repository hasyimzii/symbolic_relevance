Computer planned menus for patients with diabetes mellitus.
A computer program has been developed that has the capability to plan menus for diabetic patients. Program input includes the patient's diet prescription, usual daily meal pattern, and food preferences. The program uses a food selection algorithm that combines patient food preferences and randomization to produce menus that include foods the patient likes and that vary from day to day. The amount of each food item served at a meal is determined by an integer programming algorithm that satisfies the dietary prescription. Program output includes daily menus, weekly nutrient summaries, and a weekly shopping list. The menus includes for each food item: food name, amount in household units, numbers and types of exchanges, calories, and a space in which to write exchanges. The menu serves as a diet plan, exchange concept instructional model, and diabetic diary.
