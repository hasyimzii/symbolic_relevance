Synapsin I (protein I) in different brain regions in senile dementia of Alzheimer type and in multi infarct dementia.
Synapsin I (Protein I), a neuron specific phosphoprotein enriched in presynaptic  nerve terminals, has been used as a quantitative marker for the density of nerve terminals in five brain regions (caudate nucleus, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, mesencephalon and putamen) from patients who had suffered from Alzheimer disease/senile dementia of Alzheimer type (AD/SDAT), from patients with multi infarct dementia (MID), and from age matched controls. Samples were obtained at autopsy. Lower levels of Synapsin I were observed in the hippocampus of patients with AD/SDAT but not with MID. There were no significant differences in Synapsin I levels between patients and controls in any of the other four brain regions examined.
