Striatal dopamine receptors in Alzheimer type dementia.
Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors were studied in putamen of post mortem brains from controls and patients with Alzheimer type dementia (ATD). A significant reduction in dopamine D2 receptors was observed in ATD, whereas dopamine D1 receptors were unchanged. Neurochemical markers of striatal acetylcholine and GABA containing neurones were also within the normal range. The results are consistent with a loss of D2 receptors located on cortico striatal neurones in putamen of some ATD patients. In contrast, markers of intrinsic neurones may remain unchanged.
