Reduction of N acetyl beta glucosaminidase activity in the submaxillary glands of streptozotocin diabetic mice.
Streptozotocin diabetes strongly reduced the N acetyl beta glucosaminidase activity in the submaxillary glands of mice. A reciprocal change was observed between the enzyme activity and blood sugar in diabetes. Insulin treatment of th diabetic mice returned the reduced activity to the normal level. Isoelectric focusing analysis showed that the submaxillary gland enzyme was composed of two isozymes having isoelectric points (pI) of 4.8 and 8.8. Only the pI 8.8 isozyme was affected by the diabetes.
