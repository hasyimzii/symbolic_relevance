Homotransplant of the isolated pancreas in the rat, with suppression of exocrine secretion. Results and considerations.
Twenty isolated pancreas allotransplantations were performed in "inbred" diabetic rats, after suppression of the exocrine secretion by injecting an acrylate glue into the ductal system. Metabolic investigations have demonstrated that the transplanted organ is able to restore the glycidic balance, whole histologic studies have shown that the acrylate glue produces pancreatic exocrine athrophy, without damaging Langerhans islets.
