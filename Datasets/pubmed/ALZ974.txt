Somatostatin immunoreactivity is reduced in Parkinson's disease dementia with Alzheimer's changes.
Somatostatin like immunoreactivity (SLI) was measured in postmortem brain tissue  from 15 control patients, 7 non demented parkinsonian patients and 7 demented parkinsonian patients who had Alzheimer type cortical pathology. The non demented parkinsonian patients had normal concentrations of SLI in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, caudate or globus pallidus. Demented parkinsonian patients with Alzheimer type cortical pathology had significantly reduced (approximately 40%) levels of SLI in both the frontal (Brodmann area 6) and temporal (Brodmann area 21) cortex. These findings suggest that parkinsonian dementia with Alzheimer type pathology like Alzheimer's disease itself, is associated with reduced concentrations of cortical somatostatin.
