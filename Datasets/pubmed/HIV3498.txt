Filariasis and malaria sera from Orissa lack HTLV III antibody reactivity.
Reports exist indicating a correlation between seropositivity for human T lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) antibodies and certain parasitic infections in some parts of the world. In 274 filariasis and 119 malaria sera examined from Orissa, none was reactive in a test for anti HTLV III antibodies.
