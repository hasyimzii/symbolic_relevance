Choroidovitreal neovascular ingrowth after photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
In eight patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy treated with focal photocoagulation for preretinal new vessels, recurrent preretinal new vessel systems supplied from the choroid developed. Subsequent treatment in most cases failed to produce permanent obliteration of the new vessels networks.
