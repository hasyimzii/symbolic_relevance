Gastric lymphomas and pseudolymphomas.
We report 30 cases of non Hodgkin's gastric lymphomas (according to the Rappaport classification): 1 nodular lymphocytic lymphoma well differentiated, 7 diffuse lymphocytic lymphomas poorly differentiated, 2 diffuse mixed cellularity lymphomas, 20 diffuse histiocytic lymphomas and 4 pseudolymphomas, over a period of 21 years at the CHUV, in Lausanne (1958 1979). There are 56% of advanced stages (IIIE and IVE) according to Ann Arbor. Survival to 5 years is of 27%. The mean survival of patients who died from their lymphomas is of 5 months only. Lymph node invasion worsens considerably the prognosis (75% of survival to 5 years for stage IE against 25% for stage IIE). This phenomenon is particular to non ganglionary lymphomas. We do not observe good remission for the diffuse histiocytic forms at an advanced stage, remission being characteristic of the ganglionary lymphomas only. Treatment is poorly codified. Surgery along seems possible for the localised forms (IE): triple therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) is necessary for advanced stages and histological unfavorable forms.
