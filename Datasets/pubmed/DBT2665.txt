Diabetic truncal mononeuropathy: electromyographic evaluation.
Fifteen diabetic subjects wih thoracic radiculopathy were studied wih paraspinal  electromyography. The majority were elderly, mature onset diabetics presenting with unilateral hyperesthesia in a thoracic radicular pattern. None was under adequate control at onset, but control did not seem to alter the symptoms. Electromyography demonstrated localized paraspinal positive waves at the appropriate clinical level. Although not all subjects presented wih peripheral neuropathy, the majority showed electromyographic alteration. This should be an important adjunct in evaluation of diabetic patients with truncal mononeuropathy.
