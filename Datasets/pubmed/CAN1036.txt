Osteosclerosis associated with systemic mastocytosis.
Case report of a 60 year old man who had suffered from urticaria pigmentosa for the last 18 years of his life. The main autopsy finding was systemic mastocytosis of the bone marrow accompanied by severe osteosclerosis of the axial skeleton. Histologic examination revealed a characteristic pattern of the bone marrow; it contained foci of mast cells surrounded by a dense network of reticulin fibers, inducing a pathologic structure of spongy bone. A review of the literature confirms the high incidence of osteosclerotic alterations in patients with mastocytosis. These may be considered a sign of bone marrow involvement in urticaria pigmentosa.
