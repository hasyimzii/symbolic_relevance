A patient oriented diabetes education program.
Successful control of diabetes mellitus requires that the patient assume primary  responsibility for treatment of his or her disease. The University of Southern California Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy, using the Pico Rivera Health Center as a teaching site, instituted an educational program for diabetic members of the community. Pretests and posttests showed that there was an increase in knowledge for those who participated in the classes. The pharmacist and physician interns also gained experience in providing community education.
