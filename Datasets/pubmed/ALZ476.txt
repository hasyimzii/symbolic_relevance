Low serum vitamin B12 in Alzheimer type dementia.
Serum vitamin B12 levels (as determined by radio immunoassay) were measured in 20 subjects aged 65 years and over with Alzheimer type dementia, 20 age matched subjects with non Alzheimer type dementia and 20 age matched subjects with no dementia. Serum vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower and serum vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly more frequent in subjects with Alzheimer type dementia and were independent of age, sex, haematological abnormality or serum folate.
