Human leukocyte A and B antigens in patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma.
An increasing number of diseases has been associated with specific human leukocyte antigens. A total of 100 white men with adenocarcinoma of the prostate was serotyped for 32 A and B antigens. Compared to a control population of 169 white subjects relative risks of 2 or more were associated with the antigens A11 and A29. Relative risks of 0.20 or less were associated with the antigens AW23, BW21 and BW22. None of these relative risks was significant statistically. We were unable to demonstrate a significant human leukocyte A or B antigen association with adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
