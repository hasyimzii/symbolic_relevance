Use of condoms in relation to risk behavior among the heterosexual population in Norway.
In a questionnaire survey on sexual behaviour, a random sample of 10,000 Norwegians aged 18 through 60 were asked about use of condoms during their last intercourse. The response rate was 62.7%. Except as regards level of education, the response group was fairly representative of the population with respect to socio demographic variables. About 12% reported use of condom. Among subjects who reported extra marital partners, about 7% used condoms (both with their permanent and their extra marital partner), whereas about 12% of subjects who did not have extramarital sex used condoms. 15% of the single persons reported use of condom. Apparently, the use of condoms is not related to sexual behaviour correlated with risk of HIV infection, such as the number of partners and knowledge about the partner. Neither is perceived risk, as measured by HIV testing behaviour, related to the use of condoms.
