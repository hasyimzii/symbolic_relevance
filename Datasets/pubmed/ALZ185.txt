Alzheimer's disease and maternal age.
Findings from several studies suggest a relationship between Alzheimer's disease  and Down's syndrome. It has long been known that advanced maternal age is a risk factor for Down's syndrome, and that mothers who give birth to a child with this syndrome have characteristics consistent with accelerated aging. Little is known about risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, other than age. In this study, documentation is supplied for a hypothesis concerning a relationship between Alzheimer's disease and advanced maternal age.
