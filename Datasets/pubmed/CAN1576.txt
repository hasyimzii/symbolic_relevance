IgG and other proteins associated with human carcinomas and cancer free tissue from the same organs.
Eluates of different were prepared at 56 degrees C using a continuous flow technique. More IgG and other serum proteins were found in liver from patients with non malignant diseases than in liver tissue from healthy control individuals. Cancer free liver tissue from patients with carcinomas was similar to that of patients with non malignant diseases, but liver metastases contained twice the amount of IgG. No differences were found between non perfused carcinomas of the kidney and cancer free renal tissue, whereas more IgG was present in perfused carcinomas of the kidney than in cancer free renal tissue. Most eluates of the malignant tissues and of the cancer free renal tissue showed a reduced ratio of albumin IgG compared to that of serum or extracts, indicating a binding of IgG to antigens and/or receptors.
