Elevated levels of interferon induced 2' 5' oligoadenylate synthetase in generalized persistent lymphadenopathy and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
The levels of the 2' 5' oligoadenylate enzyme synthetase in extracts of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS related complex (ARC) were measured and compared with synthetase levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMs) from healthy heterosexual and homosexual controls. The mean basal synthetase level in heterosexual and homosexual controls was 14 +/  13 and 12 +/  9 pmol per hr/10(5) PBMs, respectively. Thirteen individuals with AIDS had a mean basal level of 129 +/  75 pmol. Serial levels were persistently elevated in six of these individuals over a one  to 10 month period. Twelve of the 13 individuals had antibodies to human T cell lymphotrophic virus III/lymphadenopathy associated virus (HTLV III/LAV). Thirty three individuals with ARC had a mean basal synthetase level of 68 +/  84 pmol. Thirty two of the 33 had antibodies to HTLV III/LAV. Eleven (33%) have had consistently normal synthetase levels (less than 2 SD above the mean for the homosexual controls, i.e., 30 pmol) over a three  to nine month follow up period. Fourteen (42%) had persistently elevated levels over the same period; four (29%) of these developed AIDS during the follow up period. Eight have had fluctuating levels but have remained clinically well. These studies suggest that persistently elevated synthetase levels in individuals with ARC and antibodies to HTLV III/LAV indicate progressive virus induced disease activity. Elevated synthetase levels may be an important prognostic indicator of increased risk of progression to AIDS.
