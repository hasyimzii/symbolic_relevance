Oral hypoglycaemic plants in West Africa.
West African hypoglycaemic plants are grouped according to their main active components. Also considered are those with constituents identical or closely related to recognised hypoglycaemic components from related species growing elsewhere in the world. The action of the African constituents is still to be confirmed pharmacologically. Where important hypoglycaemic action was found in introduced plants currently cultivated in the area (e.g. foodcrops) these have also been included.
