Cell killing by ultraviolet inactivated human immunodeficiency virus.
Extensive cell killing and cytopathology were observed within 24 hr after exposure of a clonal cell line of human T 4 lymphocytes (RH9) to culture supernatants containing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Ultraviolet irradiated HIV containing culture fluids were also capable of killing RH9 cells and of inducing specific cytopathic effects which were indistinguishable from those induced by unirradiated virus containing preparations. The uv irradiated HIV was incapable of forming proviral DNA using the endogenous virion genomic RNA as a template. The RH9 cells persistently infected with HIV did not release soluble cytotoxic factors to account for the cell killing observed when culture supernatants were added to uninfected RH9 cells. The fraction involved in cell killing had the hydrodynamic properties of a retrovirus. These results suggest that a virion component is responsible for cell killing by HIV.
