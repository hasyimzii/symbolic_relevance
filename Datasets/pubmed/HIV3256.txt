Management of human immunodeficiency virus induced thrombocytopenia in hemophilia.
Three patients with severe hemophilia and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection seropositive for virus antibody, presented with thrombocytopenia. Treatment with prednisolone, danazol (in one patient) and intravenous gammaglobulin, produced only transient responses. In one case, danazol treatment resulted in a rash, fever and a further fall in platelet count. The use of combined intravenous gammaglobulin and splenectomy successfully resulted in sustained elevation of platelet counts in all three patients. These counts have remained elevated at eight months, ten months and 17 months after operation.
