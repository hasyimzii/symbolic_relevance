Absence of infectious HIV 1 in the urine of seropositive viremic subjects.
Urine and peripheral blood samples from 48 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) seropositive individuals (38 adults and 10 children) were evaluated for the presence of HIV 1 by cocultivation and for HIV 1 p24 antigen by ELISA. None of the urine samples contained replication competent HIV 1; 41 (85%) of 48 simultaneously obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples contained replication competent HIV 1. None of 26 urine samples available for analysis contained HIV 1 p24 antigen as determined by ELISA; 12 (34%) of 35 simultaneously obtained peripheral blood samples had detectable serum HIV 1 p24 antigen. Two of the individuals studied had HIV nephropathy, three had pyuria, and five had microscopic hematuria. Culture sensitivity was maximal when mycostatin (and not amphotericin B) was used as an antifungal agent. Our findings indicate that urine from HIV 1 seropositive individuals is unlikely to contain infectious HIV 1. This would imply that the risk of transmission of HIV 1 by urine is low to nonexistent.
