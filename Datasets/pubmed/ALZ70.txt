An immunoperoxidase study of senile cerebral amyloidosis with pathogenetic considerations.
Samples of human cerebral cortex were obtained from twelve autopsied patients with Alzheimer's disease or "normal" aging. Rabbit or goat anti human antisera to the following plasma proteins: IgG, F(ab')2, Fc, kappa and lambda light chains, IgM, IgA, fibrinogen, albumin, C3, lysozyme, haptoglobin, macroglobulin, and microglobulin; antibodies to the following intracellular proteins: glial fibrillary acidic (GFA) protein, filamin, actin, non muscle myosin, tubulin, cholinergic vesicle proteins, and neurofilament (NF) proteins were utilized in the immunoglobulin peroxidase bridge. Amyloid cores of classical or perivascular plaques and dyshoric angiopathy exhibited a strong reaction for intact IgG and for both of its light chains, moderate reactions for lysozyme, fibrinogen, albumin and IgA, and weak reactions for IgM, C3, Fc, F(ab')2, haptoglobin, macroglobulin and microglobulin. Antibodies to all three NF proteins, individually and pooled, stained dyshoric and plaque amyloid, while antibodies to other intracellular proteins did not. The coronae of classical plaques and many primitive plaques stained for GFA, but inconsistently for IgG, both light chains, lysozyme, actin, tubulin, and NF proteins. Affected vessels of three patients with Congophilic angiopathy were reactive for all plasma proteins (especially IgG, fibrinogen, and albumin) and for NF proteins. NF staining in Congophilic blood vessels, although variable, revealed a peripheral or adventitial distribution, whereas plasma proteins tended to be localized in the media of the vessel wall. The distributions of Congo red and NF positivity were often identical. Both NF and Congo red staining was sensitive to oxidation. Isolated NF proteins were Congophilic and capable of displaying apple green birefringence. A hypothesis concerning the role of NF proteins in senile cerebral amyloid is presented.
