Choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity in neuritic plaques of Alzheimer brain.
We have observed dystrophic choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) positive processes surrounding the amyloid core of neuritic plaques in human neocortex, amygdala and hippocampus, using a polyclonal anti human ChAT antiserum. These data, and those from studies of the aged monkey by other investigators, provide a morphologic counterpart for the biochemical abnormality of the cholinergic system in Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
