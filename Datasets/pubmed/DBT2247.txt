Role of ATP in specific binding of 125I insulin to cytoplasmic receptors of the  liver and muscle membranes of controls and diabetic rats.
A study was made of the action of various concentrations of ATP on insulin ability to bind to the receptors of the liver and muscle membranes in control and streptozocin induced diabetes animals. Specific binding of 125I insulin to the receptors of the liver and muscle membranes was shown to rise in animals with streptozocin induced diabetes as compared to control. This effect was most pronounced in the muscle membranes. Preincubation of the membranes with ATP did not affect insulin binding to the liver and muscle receptors of control animals. However, hormone binding to the liver receptors of diabetic rats was drastically suppressed by ATP (10( 3) M). Less ATP concentrations (10(12) M) produced an additional inhibitory action which was not marked. ATP led to decreased insulin binding to the muscle receptors of diabetic rats only at extremely low concentrations (10( 12) M). The data obtained may be of importance for regulation of membrane phosphorylation in the states characteristic of insulin resistance.
