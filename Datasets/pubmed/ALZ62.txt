Instrumental neutron activation analysis of brain aluminum in Alzheimer disease and aging.
Instrumental neutron activation analysis procedures were used to determine the aluminum content of various brain regions in histologically verified Alzheimer disease (AD) and in controls. The grand mean aluminum level for 74 AD specimens was 0.372 +/  0.058 microgram/gm and for 137 adult controls, 0.467 +/  0.033 microgram/gm, both on a wet weight basis. No difference was found at the bulk sample level between AD and adult controls, corrected for age and sex, or when frontal, temporal, and hippocampal specimens were compared. Control specimens (infancy to 85 years) showed an increase in brain aluminum concentration with age. Comparison of freeze dried to wet weight ratios of AD and controls revealed a small increase in water content in AD brains.
