Studies of Fc gamma receptors of human B lymphocytes: phospholipase A2 activity of Fc gamma receptors.
The presence of phospholipase A2 activity within human B cell Fc gamma receptors  was investigated. Lysate produced by detergent treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells that had 1% of the cells surface radioiodinated was subjected to affinity chromatography by using either rac 1 (9 carboxynonyl) 2 hexadecylglycero 3 phosphorylcholine Sepharose (PC Sepharose) or heat aggregated human IgG Sepharose 4B conjugate (IgG Sepharose). The materials eluted from both adsorbants by ethylenediaminetetraacetate  or urea containing buffer were further purified by gel filtration and isoelectric focusing in the presence of 6 M urea. Both isolated PC  and IgG binding materials were homogeneous, when judged by gel filtration and isoelectric focusing, and had identical isoelectric points (pI = 6.5), peptide maps, and amino acid compositions. Furthermore, both preparations catalyzed equally the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to release fatty acid from the 2 position. Optimal enzymatic activity depended on the presence of Ca2+, was maximal at pH 9.5, and was augmented by Fc gamma fragments. Both preparations specifically bound to the Fc portion of IgG and inhibited human antibody coated erythrocyte rosette formation by peripheral mononuclear cells. Our data thus demonstrate the identity of PC  and IgG binding materials and suggest that a functional activity of the human B cell Fc gamma receptor is the generation of phospholipase A2 activity within the plasma membrane.
