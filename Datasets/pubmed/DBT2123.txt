Ca2+ uptake and distribution in alloxan diabetic rat arterial and venous smooth muscle.
This report demonstrates that in experimental diabetes mellitus (DM) calcium uptake and its distribution is altered in rat aortic but not in portal venous smooth muscle. Results are interpreted as consequences of increased calcium binding by aortic smooth muscle in experimental DM, which could account for the hyporeactivity of alloxan diabetic rat aorta reported previously.
