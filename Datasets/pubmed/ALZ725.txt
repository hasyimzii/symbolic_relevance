Dissociation of neuropeptide Y and somatostatin in Parkinson's disease.
The concentration of neuropeptide Y has been determined in the cortex and hippocampus of subjects with Parkinson's disease and compared to changes of activity of dopamine beta hydroxylase and concentration of somatostatin. Despite a marked reduction in the concentration of somatostatin in the severely demented subject, in both cortex and hippocampus, no significant change in concentration of NPY was found in either region. This finding therefore suggests that the majority of NPY within the cortex is independent of somatostatin. This study provides some further evidence of neurochemical similarities between the dementia of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
