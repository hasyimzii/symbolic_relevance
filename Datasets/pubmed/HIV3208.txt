Structural characterization of reverse transcriptase and endonuclease polypeptides of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome retrovirus.
Automated N terminal microsequencing of immune affinity purified acquired immunodeficiency syndrome retrovirus polypeptides from infected cells was used to locate the N termini of 64 , 51 , and 34 kilodalton (kDa) polypeptides within the pol open reading frame (ORF) of the proviral DNA. The 64  and 51 kDa proteins had identical N termini (Pro Ile Ser Pro IIe Glu Thr Val ) positioned 156 residues from the beginning of the pol ORF. The N terminus of the 34 kDa pol gene product, Phe Leu Asp Gly Ile Asp Lys , mapped 716 residues into the pol ORF. These polypeptides were absent in an RT negative, CD4 negative, persistently infected cell line (8E5) carrying a single defective copy of a constitutively expressed, integrated proviral DNA.
