Hypoglycemia and hemostatic parameters in juvenile onset diabetes.
Hypoglycemia was induced by intravenous infusion of insulin in six juvenile onset diabetic subjects. Hemostatic parameters were assessed before insulin infusion and 0, 1, and 2 h after discontinuation of insulin infusion. The onset of hypoglycemia coincided with an enhancement of ADP induced platelet aggregation in five of the patients; platelet aggregation returned to normal levels during the next 2 h. The recalcification time was significantly shortened at the onset of hypoglycemia and continued to decrease for the next 2 h despite the return of serum glucose to normal levels. Correspondingly, a significant increase in fibrinogen was found. The ethanol gelation test was positive in two patients 2 h after stopping insulin infusion. Platelet counts decreased significantly after stopping insulin infusion. Thus, insulin induced hypoglycemia markedly affects hemostatic balance and may potentially lead to intravascular coagulation in juvenile onset diabetic patients.
