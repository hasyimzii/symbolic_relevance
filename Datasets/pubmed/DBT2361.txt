Possibilities for ocular vessel coagulation (author's transl).
Present day possibilities of influencing pathological ocular vessels using an argon laser are presented. A distinction is made here between indirect methods such as area coagulation and direct methods with which specific vessels are treated. Whereas clinical tests involving vessel coagulation with pigmented epithelium absorption have already been carried out more or less successfully, selective vessel coagulation with hemoglobin absorption is still largely at the experimental stage. Our own experiments on animals have shown, however, that with the selection of a suitable coagulation technique and the use of suitable exposure parameters, vessel occlusion can be induced with the argon laser. To achieve this, shortening of the exposure times is particularly necessary.
