The "WTL" model of cancer care.
Family conference and oncology tutoring programs have been attended by 1,000 patients, family members, and support persons. Patients are taught to become active participants in their therapy, and families learn communication skills. Evaluation questionnaires reveal that ninety four percent felt a significant improvement in family patient communication. Ninety three percent felt that personal needs related to the disease of cancer were accurately addressed. And ninety seven percent indicated they would be referring others to the service.
