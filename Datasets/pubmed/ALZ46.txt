Studies on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by neutron activation analysis  2. Comparative study of analytical results on Guam PD, Japanese ALS and Alzheimer disease cases.
Metal analysis of calcium, manganese, aluminum and copper in CNS tissue samples of degenerative CNS disease cases (six Japanese ALS, three Japanese Alzheimer disease, four Guam PD, one Guam ALS) using neutron activation analysis, was conducted with following results: Five of six Japanese ALS cases, two of three Japanese Alzheimer disease cases and all of four Guam PD cases showed a high content of calcium and aluminum in CNS tissue with a significant positive correlation between calcium and aluminum and/or between calcium and manganese. These findings suggest a possible process of metal induced soft tissue calcification with interaction of other di  and/or trivalent cations such as aluminum, manganese in CNS tissue of these degenerative CNS diseases.
