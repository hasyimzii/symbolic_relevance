Oligosaccharide mediated interactions of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of HIV 1 that are independent of CD4 recognition.
In this study carbohydrate mediated interactions of the envelope glycoprotein, gp120, of HIV 1 were investigated. Oligosaccharide probes (neoglycolipids), prepared from the N glycosidically linked chains of the natural and recombinant forms of gp120, were used in conjunction with the intact glycoprotein to investigate reactivities with a soluble carbohydrate binding protein (lectin) known as mannose binding protein in human serum. Evidence is presented that the high mannose type oligosaccharides with seven, eight and nine mannose residues from both forms of gp120 are recognized by the serum lectin, and that these reactivities are unrelated to CD4 recognition. Reactivities of the two forms of envelope glycoprotein with macrophages derived from human blood monocytes and with the mannose specific macrophage endocytosis receptor isolated from human placental membranes were also investigated. Evidence is presented that both forms of gp120 bind to the macrophage surface by multiple interactions in addition to CD4 binding, and that among these interactions is a carbohydrate mediated binding to the endocytosis receptor. We propose that such carbohydrate mediated interactions could form the basis of viral attachment to a variety of healthy and diseased tissues.
