HLA linked complement markers in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease: C4 variant  (C4B2) a possible marker for senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
We determined the gene frequencies for the alleles of the HLA linked complement markers C2, properdin factor B (BF), C4A (Rodgers) and C4B (Chido), and the red cell enzyme glyoxalase I in 38 unrelated patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, 42 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and 59 unaffected, aged matched control blood donors. In senile dementia of the Alzheimer type and in Parkinson's disease, no significant difference was found in the gene frequencies of alleles at either the BF, C2, or GLO I locus compared with those of age matched controls. In senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, a striking increase in the frequency of the rare C4B locus allele, C4*B2, was apparent, resulting in the high relative risk of RR = 8.8 (p less than 0.0001) for this disorder.
