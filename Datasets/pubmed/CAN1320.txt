Some short chain N6 substituted adenosine analogues with antitumor properties.
The compounds N6 allyl , N6 isopropyl , N6 propargyl , and N6 (2 methylallyl)adenosine were prepared by reacting 6 chloropurine riboside with an excess of the corresponding amines in ethanol, in the presence of two acid acceptors resulting in virtually quantitative yields. The compounds showed biological activity in a number of in vitro and in vivo tumor cell systems. Very good increases in life spans of mice bearing mammary carcinoma were obtained by treatment with the N6 allyl, N6 isopropyl, and N6 propargyl analogues, respectively. In rats, the N6 allyl analogue slowed the rate of transplantable mammary tumor growth by one fourth. The short chain adenosine analogues are more active in the treatment of animal carcinomas than in the leukemia or sarcoma tumor cell systems.
