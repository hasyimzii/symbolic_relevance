An embryo protein induced by SV40 virus transformation of mouse cells.
A specific protein of molecular weight (MW) approximately 55,000 (55K) was found  recently by immunoprecipitation in all SV40 virus transformed mammalian cells, in addition to the SV40 large T antigen (appoximately 94K) and small antigen (approximately 17K), which are the only proteins coded by the 'early half' of the SV40 genome. The 55K protein is encoded by cellular DNA; its peptide pattern is different from that of the SV40 antigens and it is species specific in mouse, rat, hamster, monkey and human SV40 transformed (or infected) cells. A 55K protein with a similar peptide pattern was found in mouse embryonal carcinoma cells not exposed to SV40. Similar proteins were reported in mouse sarcomas and leukaemias induced by a great variety of aetiological agents and also in a spontaneously transformed mouse fibroblast cell line, and it has been suggested that the protein may be a general correlated of cellular tumorigenicity. We now report that the approximately 55K protein is present in primary cell cultures from 12 14 day old mouse embryos, but not in 16 day old mouse embryos. The embryo protein has a peptide pattern virtually indistinguishable from that of the SV40 induced protein. We also show by comparing closely related cell families that spontaneously transformed highly tumorigenic mouse cells do not possess the 55K protein.
