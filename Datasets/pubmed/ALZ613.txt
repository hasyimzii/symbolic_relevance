Brain research in Germany from the gerontologic viewpoint. Problem status and international comparison.
Well documented epidemiological studies unequivocally demonstrated that dementia  rapidly increases with advancing age, producing a number of personal, family, medical and socioeconomic problems in the highly developed countries, West Germany included. Therefore, brain research in gerontology should concentrate on dementia research. International endeavors in dementia research are reported and compared with those undertaken in West Germany. Whereas dementia research has for some time been receiving major support either from scientific institutions or the government in countries such as USA, UK, France and Italy, it has not become a central topic of interest in West Germany.
