Endometrial adenocarcinoma arising in adenomyosis.
Endometrial adenocarcinoma and adenomyosis are both common problems arising in the uterus. Interestingly, there are few reports of the combination of these two pathologic entities. A recent experience with eight cases found in the files of the Gynecologic Pathology Laboratory at The Johns Hopkins Hospital between the years 1955 and 1974 are reported. Of significance is the differential in prognosis between such cases with deep involvement and true invasive disease.
