Assessment of treatment of retinal angiopathies (author's transl).
Angiopathies of the retina are the most common cause of blindness. Since it is difficult to assess the success of treatment by measuring visual acuity, not only because of restriction to the central area, today's trend is increasingly towards determination of capillary resistance, capillary permeability and platelet aggregation as objective criteria. The principles and relation to underlying diseases are discussed. As an example of variation of these parameters under the influence of capillary active substances, the effects of hydroxy ethylated rutosides are discussed.
