Measure of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c: its value in the control of juvenile insulin dependent diabetes (author's transl).
HbA1c percentage was determined in 82 insulin dependent juvenile diabetic patients. The concentration of HbA1c reflects the level of chronic hyperglycaemia during the preceding 4 to 8 weeks and appears to correlate closely with the commonly used methods for monitoring diabetic control. HbA1c measurement provides a reliable and objective test for periodic assessment of insulin dependent juvenile diabetes. It may serve as a valuable tool for determining the level of metabolic control in each patient and measuring the effectiveness of various therapeutic regimens.
