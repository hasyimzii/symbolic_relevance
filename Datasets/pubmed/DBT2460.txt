A defect in cell mediated immune function in insulin resistant diabetic and obese subjects.
In this study, we have evaluated one aspect of the cellular immune process  in vitro release of MIF by lymphocytes obtained from controls; well controlled, ketosis prone, insulin dependent diabetic patients; nonketotic diabetic patients; and nonhyperglycemic obese patients. The results showed that MIF release by cells from well controlled, insulin dependent diabetic, nonketotic diabetic, and nonhyperglycemic obese subjects was 100% +/  8, 48% +/  17, and 36% +/  17 of control values, respectively. Thus insulin sensitive, ketosis prone diabetic patients have normal MIf release while well controlled on insulin therapy, whereas insulin resistant, nonketotic diabetic and nonhyperglycemic obese patients have impaired MIF release. It is possible that this in vitro defect in a cellular immune process is related to the insulin resistant state and that it may play a role in enhanced susceptibility to infection in insulin resistant diabetic patients.
