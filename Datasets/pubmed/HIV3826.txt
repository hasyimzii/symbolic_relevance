Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB).
Current surveillance data indicate that the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has increased the risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). After years of decline, in 1986, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported a 2.6% rise in the number of cases of TB. The dual diagnosis of TB and HIV infection is being reported more frequently, especially among the inner city poor, racial and ethnic minorities, and intravenous drug users. Nurses need to be aware that intradermal tuberculin testing may be unreliable in HIV infected persons and that monitoring for treatment compliance may be difficult. Additionally, nurses should be aware of guidelines to minimize the potential for occupational exposure and the need for reporting all new cases and non compliant persons to local health departments.
