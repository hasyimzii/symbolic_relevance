Human herpes virus type 6 (HHV 6) and its in vitro effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Human herpes virus type 6 (HHV 6) was isolated from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Antibodies to this herpes virus were found to be widespread among adults and children in Western Australia. Co infection studies indicated that HIV replication was inhibited by the presence of HHV 6.
