The specificity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 transactivator is different from that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
The recently described human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV2) is significantly divergent in sequence from the more frequently isolated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1). Both HIV1 and HIV2 encode a transactivator that is capable of strongly stimulating expression directed by the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). Here, we define the region of the HIV2 genome encoding the transactivator and show that the specificity of the transactivator differs from that of HIV1. By deletion analysis of the HIV2 LTR, we show that both HIV1 and HIV2 transactivators require sequences within 35 to 53 bp downstream of the start of transcription. However, in order to stimulate expression at full efficiency, the HIV2 transactivator further requires sequences unique to the HIV2 LTR between nucleotides +53 and +99. Hence, HIV2 poorly transactivates the LTR of HIV1, while two divergent isolates of HIV1 will efficiently transactivate the LTR of either HIV1 or HIV2. Nonetheless, in vivo competition between the transactivators of HIV1 and HIV2 suggests that they use a common mechanism.
