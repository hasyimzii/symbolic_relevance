Colchicine and insulin secretion in man.
The present study is aimed at investigating the effect of acute and chronic colchicine administration on insulin secretion in humans. Acute insulin response to glucose (0.33 g/kg) was significantly decreased by colchicine (3 mg i.v.). In fact, this response (mean change 2 10 min insulin) was 44 +/  8 microunits/ml before and 32 +/  6 microunits/ml after colchicine administration (P less than 0.01). As a consequence of this, glucose disappearance rates were reduced (P less than 0.05). Infusion of lysine acetylsalicylate (LAS), an inhibitor of endogenous PG synthesis, completely reversed the inhibitory effect of colchicine upon
