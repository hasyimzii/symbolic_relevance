Primary and secondary involvement of the CNS in HIV infection.
The neurologic sequelae of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may be divided into primary (= HIV induced) and secondary (= opportunistic infections and malignancies) manifestations. Our experience with 215 HIV infected patients indicates that major clinical symptoms are due to a few, albeit important, neurologic diseases, although in a given patient rare and sometimes multiple complications have to be considered. The clinical features of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) encephalopathy and CNS toxoplasmosis that represent the major primary and secondary neurologic manifestations of AIDS are discussed in detail.
