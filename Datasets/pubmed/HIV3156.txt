Antibodies to human immuno deficiency virus and human T cell leukemia virus type  I in Japanese patients with hematologic malignancies.
One thousand six hundred and seventy four blood samples drawn between January 1980 and April 1986 from 1454 Japanese, including 251 leukemia, 409 lymphoma, 76 adult T cell leukemia and 25 benign lymphadenitis patients, were tested for antibodies to HIV and HTLV I. No patient with lymphadenitis or lymphoma associated with HIV infection was found. In 87 patients with acute and chronic leukemias who had received multiple transfusions, 8 were positive for anti HTLV I antibody after blood transfusions amounting to 115 units, on average, while no patient was positive for anti HIV antibody. Overall, no sample was positive for anti HIV antibody, whereas 153 (10.5%) were positive for anti HTLV I antibody. These results indicate that the transmission of HIV by blood transfusions is far less prevalent than that of HTLV I in Tokyo at present.
