Histocompatibility antigens and antibodies to viral and other antigens in Alzheimer pre senile dementia.
Alzheimer's disease may arise from an interaction between a conventional infective agent and a particular disease susceptibility (related to the HLA A or B locus). HLA antigens and antibodies to conventional infective agents were examined in 14 patients with pre senile dementia. Most of the sample probably suffered Alzheimer's disease, though one subject may have had Pick's disease. No particular HLA type or antibody was associated with the sample.
