The effect of glucagon infusion on kidney function in short term insulin dependent juvenile diabetics.
Kidney function was studied in nine, metabolically well controlled, short term insulin dependent male diabetics before and during glucagon infusion of 4 to 5 and 8 to 10 ng/kg/min. Glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow (steady state infusion technique, with urinary collections, using 125I iothalamate and 131I iodohippurate), and urinary albumin and beta 2 microglobulin excretion rates were measured. The mean plasma glucagon concentration increased during infusion from 254 +/  19 pg/ml to 440 +/  31 pg/ml (low dose) and 730 +/  52 pg/ml (high dose). Glomerular filtration rate increased in all subjects from 133 +/  5 before the glucagon infusion to 141 +/  4 with the low dose, and 148 +/  7 ml/min/1.73 m2 with the high dose (p < 0.01). The increase in glomerular filtration rate correlated with the rise in plasma glucagon concentration (r = 0.67; p < 0.01). Renal plasma flow increased from 530 +/  21 before the glucagon infusion to 555 +/  20 with the low dose and 572 +/  29 ml/min/1.73 m2 with the high dose (p < 0.01). Urinary beta 2 microglobulin excretion rate rose from 5.8 +/  1.0 before infusion to 8.7 +/  1.7 with the low dose, and 17.9 +/  5.7 micrograms X 10( 2)/min with the high dose (p < 0.01). Urinary albumin excretion remained unchanged during the glucagon infusion. These results suggest that glucagon may contribute to the reversible elevation of glomerular filtration rate typically found in poorly regulated insulin dependent diabetics, but not to the moderate elevation found in well controlled diabetics.
