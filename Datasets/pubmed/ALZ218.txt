Coexistence of cognitive impairment and depression in geriatric outpatients.
The authors diagnosed depression in 20 (23%) of 88 cognitively impaired geriatric outpatients. Three (20%) of these patients had depression only, and 17 (85%) had depression superimposed on an underlying dementia. The rate of coexisting depression decreased significantly with greater severity of the cognitive impairment: 9 (33%) of 27 mildly impaired patients were depressed, compared with 8 (23%) of 35 moderately impaired and 3 (12%) of 26 severely impaired patients. There was a nonsignificant trend for cognitively impaired women to be more likely to be depressed than for similarly impaired men. The authors conclude that although depression must be differentiated from dementia, it is equally important to consider the possibility that the diagnoses coexist.
