A comparison of the local and remote effects of basement membrane regeneration in normal and diabetic rats.
If the capsule basement membrane of the lens is partially removed, the underlying epithelial cells of the normal rat, as the animal ages, continue to produce basement membrane as if the membrane had not been disturbed. The response of the diabetic animal is quite different and basement membrane synthesis is increased by about 60%. Furthermore, this increase also occurs although at a reduced rate in the opposite eye where basement membrane was undisturbed. This might be termed a "sympathetic effect" and appears to be due to a substance or substances dissolved in the aqueous humour of the sympathizing eye and arising from increased activity of cells producing basement membrane in the other eye.
