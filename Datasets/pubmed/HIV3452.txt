Inhibition by glucosamine of myristoylation in human H9 lymphocytes and rat liver cells.
N Myristoyl transferase (NMT) activity was measured in rat liver and H9 cells using an in vitro assay based on acylation of synthetic peptides. Glucosamine was found to inhibit the NMT activity. Using a synthetic peptide mimicking the N terminus of HIV p27nef a Km value of 2.4 microM and a Vmax of 240 pmol/mg per h was found. In the presence of glucosamine the Vmax was lowered indicating that glucosamine acted as a non competitive inhibitor. Glucosamine also inhibited incorporation of radiolabelled myristic acid into H9 cell proteins in vivo. In liver cells using a peptide from the N terminus of p60 SRC only the Vmax was affected.
