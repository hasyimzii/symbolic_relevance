Induction of anti HIV neutralizing antibodies by synthetic peptides.
Two synthetic peptides containing amino acid sequences analogous to the envelope  glycoprotein of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type III (HTLV III) and lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) were produced and used to immunize rabbits. The subsequent rabbit antisera neutralized HTLV III infectivity in vitro. The two synthetic peptides corresponded to regions associated with the gp120 or gp41 subunits respectively, of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This data indicates that at least two neutralizing epitopes are present on the envelope glycoprotein of HIV and these epitopes are associated with two distinct virus envelope glycoproteins. Antisera generated against these peptides neutralized infectivity of two different isolates of HTLV III. The data is discussed in terms of possible strategy for developing an effective vaccine against the etiologic agents of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
