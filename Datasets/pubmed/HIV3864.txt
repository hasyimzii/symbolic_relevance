Coordinate enhancement of cytokine gene expression in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infected promonocytic cells.
A promonocytic cell model was used to investigate cytokine gene transcription in  U937 and U9 IIIB cells chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1). The production of interferon (alpha 1 interferon [IFN alpha 1], IFN alpha 2, and IFN beta), interleukin (interleukin 1 alpha [IL 1 alpha], IL 1 beta, and IL 6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) mRNA was characterized by quantitative polymerase chain reaction mRNA phenotyping in U937 and U9 IIIB cells following coinfection with Sendai paramyxovirus or stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Chronic HIV 1 infection of U9 IIIB cells resulted in a low constitutive level of transcription of TNF and IL 1 genes but not IFN genes; however, when the cells were coinfected with Sendai virus, 10  to 20 fold higher levels of IFN beta, IL 1 beta, IL 6, and TNF alpha mRNA were observed in U9 IIIB cells than in similarly induced U937 cells. The enhanced levels of cytokine RNA in virus infected U9 IIIB cells were also accompanied by higher levels of IFN antiviral activity and TNF secretion than in U937 cells. Transcript levels for IFN alpha 1 and IFN alpha 2 were equivalently induced in virus infected U937 and U9 IIIB cells, indicating that a generalized derepression of cytokine gene expression did not occur as a consequence of HIV 1 infection. When LPS was used as an inducer, a distinct pattern of cytokine gene expression was detected in U9 IIIB cells. TNF alpha and IL 1 beta but not IFN alpha or IFN beta transcripts were induced by LPS. These results suggest that HIV 1 infection of promonocytic cells may prime or sensitize cells such that subsequent antigenic challenge leads to coordinate enhancement of cytokine gene expression.
