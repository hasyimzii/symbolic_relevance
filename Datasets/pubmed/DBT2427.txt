Diabetic retinopathy: update on therapeutic advances.
It is clear that real advances have occurred in the therapy of diabetic retinopathy. However, this complication of diabetes can and does lead to blindness in the older patient. The present treatment modalities offer a means of maintaining or, in some patients, improving the visual performance of the patient. Laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy are the major new therapies. The future will hopefully give us a better understanding of the cause of diabetic retinopathy so that it may be prevented and cured. However, in the interim, all patients with diabetes mellitus should be urged to see on ophthalmologist yearly in order to obtain the best available therapy.
