The influence of radio  and chemotherapy on DNA repair of peripheral lymphocytes of tumor patients (author's transl).
The influence of radiotherapy in 10 patients and chemotherapy in 5 patients, on DNA excision repair capacity was investigated in lymphocytes of the peripheral blood. No effects on DNA repair were found using only betatrone of 60Co irradiation under normal conditions. Combination of both irradiation schedules over a longer period of therapy provoked an inhibition of DNA repair. Chemotherapy inhibits DNA repair immediately after starting therapy, but after a relatively short time, the extent of DNA repair increases above normal level.
