Changes in nerve conduction velocity after six weeks of glucoregulation with portable insulin infusion pumps.
Near normal glucoregulation was maintained in 10 patients with insulin dependent  (type I) diabetes mellitus for 6 wk with preprogrammed continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using a portable battery powered infusion pump (CSII). This form of therapy resulted in a statistically significant increase in motor nerve conduction velocity in the median and peroneal nerves compared with baseline values. There was no significant change in the motor nerve conduction velocity in the ulnar nerve or in the sensory nerve conduction studies. No changes occurred in five additional patients studied in similar fashion while on a conventional insulin regimen. These results suggest that the prevention of sustained hyperglycemia with CSII could theoretically result in the prevention of diabetic neuropathy. However, only long term studies of CSII will provide the information necessary to determine the clinical relevance of the findings.
