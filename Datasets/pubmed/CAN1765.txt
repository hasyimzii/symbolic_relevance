Biochemical and biologic characterization of lymphocyte regulatory molecules. IV. Purification of Interleukin 2 from a murine T cell lymphoma.
A cloned murine T cell line, LBRM 33 5A4, growing in culture can be activated by  phytohemagglutinin (PHA) to secrete Interleukin 2 (IL 2) activity. In the absence of PHA, LBRM cells do not produce IL 2. The chemical and biologic properties of LBRM derived IL 2 are compared to those of murine spleen derived IL 2. The fractionation of culture supernatants from PHA activated LBRM cells by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing (IEF) reveals that IL 2 activity is contained in a class of molecules indistinguishable in size (30,000) and charge (pI 4.3 4.7 and 4.9 5.1) from murine spleen IL 2. LBRM derived IL 2 also exhibits the entire spectrum of biologic activities exhibited by spleen IL 2, stimulating the growth of established T cell lines in culture, the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in thymocyte cultures and the induction of antibody responses in nude spleen cultures. Both LBRM and splenic derived IL 2 activities exhibit similar properties after digestion with proteases, and various chemical and temperature treatments. Since IL 2 is derived from a cloned cell line, it is likely these lymphocyte assays are detecting a single class of molecules that act directly on activated T cells. The use of LBRM cells as a source of IL 2 should greatly facilitate studies on the molecular characterization and biologic activity of this class of lymphocyte regulatory molecules.
