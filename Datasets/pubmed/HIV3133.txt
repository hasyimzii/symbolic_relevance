Ambulatory monitoring in AIDS.
Our experiences gained in the "AIDS clinic" of the department of dermatology of the University of Cologne since 1983 have shown that the medical care of patients infected with LAV/HTLV III (HIV) may well be performed by physicians in practice. This especially refers to patients with the stages WR 1 and 2. We discuss our experiences and give some practical directions.
