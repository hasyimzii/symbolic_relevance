Effect of polyvinyl pyrrolidone derivative compound on production of interleukin 1 by monocytes.
We studied the effect of 1 acetamide, 2 pyrrolidone (PVP A), a B cell mitogen derivative, on interleukin 1 (IL 1) production by peripheral blood monocytes. The compound was capable of inducing monocytes to produce IL 1 to an extent significantly lower than that induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, addition of PVP A in conjunction with LPS resulted in IL 1 superinduction. Furthermore, PVP A addition to monocytes of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) restored diminished IL 1 production by these cells to levels comparable with monocytes from age matched healthy individuals. We also examined the effect of PVP A on immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis in vitro. PVP A increased the production of both IgM and IgG by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM). We conclude, since Ig synthesis of B cells requires monocytes, that perhaps PVP A activated monocytes can boost B cells resulting in augmented Ig production.
