Circulating vitamins in Alzheimer's dementia as compared with other dementias.
Blood levels of 12 vitamins were compared in 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 58 control subjects (10 intellectually alert, 12 depressed, 28 multi infarct dementias, 8 with other specific dementias). No significant differences in vitamin blood levels were found between the Alzheimer's disease group and the control groups either individually or in total. Conventional parenteral vitamin treatment of seven patients with vitamin deficits did not benefit their cognitive state. Conventional vitamin malnutrition did not seem to contribute to the disability in these subjects.
