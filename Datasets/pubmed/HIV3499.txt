The morphological characteristics of the chondriome of human lymphoblastoid cells producing the human immunodeficiency virus.
The mitochondrial complex condition of continuous CEMT4 cell line infected by the human immunodeficiency virus has been investigated. The mitochondrial morphology of these and of intact cells was similar in great extent, though several changes were observed. For example, mitochondrial profiles with multiple dichotomous branches and anastomosis cristae were noted in the former. These changes resulted in the augmentation of the inner membrane square of mitochondrion. The formation of mitochondrial clusters connected with special junctions was a very characteristic part of the infected cell. Contacts were seen to be formed between the outer membranes neighboring profiles. These contacts look as X like little bridges, or net like or plate like structures. The mutual transition of all these structures was observed using goniometer adapter. As has been shown by the three dimensional reconstruction of mitochondrial junction zones, this area is presented by a single mitochondrion being structurally very complicated and very large in size compared to the neighbouring ones.
