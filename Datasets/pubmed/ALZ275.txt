Lecithin and memory training in suspected Alzheimer's disease.
Ten patients diagnosed clinically as having Alzheimer's disease (age range 54 to  73 years) were given 35 g/day of a 53% lecithin mixture for two weeks, in a double blind crossover design. Patients received memory training during the lecithin condition and "placebo training" during the placebo drug condition. Repeated assessment with Buschke's Selective Reminding Procedure provided no evidence of a therapeutic lecithin effect either during the two week clinical trial or during longer follow up trials. Noninvasive measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (nr CBF) by the 133Xe inhalation method, and repeated EEG's also failed to demonstrate a therapeutic effect. These latter indices reflected a decline in cerebral function over the course of the study, a finding which paralleled clinical impressions in four of the patients. Follow up trials of memory training under placebo and lecithin conditions provided some suggestion that memory training may lead to some immediate improvement in list learning ability, but the improvement was not well maintained overtime.
