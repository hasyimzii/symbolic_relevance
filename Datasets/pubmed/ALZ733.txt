Red blood cell abnormalities in Alzheimer disease.
In a prospective, double blind study of 84 unselected persons in a dementia clinic, the red blood cell/plasma choline ratios were found to be significantly higher in 47 subjects with clinically defined Alzheimer disease (DAT) than in 37 non DAT, nondepressed subjects (3.54 +/  0.48 versus 2.04 +/  0.34, p less than 0.02). The latter group included intellectually intact subjects as well as patients with other dementias who were comparable to the Alzheimer patients in age, sex, and degree of cognitive impairment. The elevated mean ratio reflected the greater proportion of Alzheimer patients with high red blood cell plasma choline ratios. These elevated ratios appeared to be related to both increases in red cell content and decreases in plasma choline. The authors conclude that the results confirm and extend those previously reported in short series of patients and agree with other evidence that Alzheimer disease has systemic manifestations in nonneural cells, which may be useful in further investigations of the disease's cellular pathophysiology.
