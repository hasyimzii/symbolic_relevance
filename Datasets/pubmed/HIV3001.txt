Comparative utilization of the alpha keto and D  and L alpha hydroxy analogs of leucine, isoleucine and valine by chicks and rats.
Several experiments were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the growth promoting capacity of the isomers of the branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and their alpha hydroxy and alpha keto analogs for the chick and rat. Basal chemically defined diets were formulated to be singly deficient in the BCAA under study; analogs therefore were evaluated as sources of supplemental amino acid activity. DL Isoleucine (DL Ile), alpha keto beta L methylvaleric acid (KMV) and the isomers of alpha hydroxy beta methylvaleric acid (HMV) were inferior to an isomolar level of L Ile and varied considerably in their capacity to support growth of chicks and rats. Efficacy values of the compounds for chicks (C) and rats (R) were: DL Ile 85% (C), 58% (R); KMV 60% (C), 38% (R); L HMV 84% (C), 65% (R); DL HMV 49% (C), 45% (R); and D HMV  10% (C),  2% (R). The isomers of valine (Val) and alpha hydroxyisovaleric acid (HIV) had efficacy values in chicks of: DL Val, 84%; D Val, 72%; L HIV, 82%; DL HIV, 79%; D HIV, 66%. D Val had only marginal growth promoting activity for rats, 16%. All Val analogs had comparable efficacy values for the rat: alpha ketoisovaleric acid (KIV), 49%; L HIV, 54%; DL HIV, 51%; and D HIV, 46%. DL Leu and D Leu, alpha ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), and L , DL  and D alpha hydroxyisocaproic acid (HIC) were all less efficacious than isomolar amounts of supplemental L Leu in rats. Efficacy values were: DL Leu, 78%; D Leu, 48%; KIC, 56%; L HIC, 58%; DL HIC, 55%; and D HIC, 41%. The BCAA keto analogs were not superior to the L alpha hydroxy analogs in growth promoting capacity, and this is of great interest for the potential use of these nitrogen free amino acid analogs in nutritional therapy.
