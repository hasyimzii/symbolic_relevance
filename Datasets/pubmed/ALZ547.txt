Human health situation and chromosome alterations: sister chromatid exchange frequency in lymphocytes from passive smokers and patients with hereditary diseases.
Lymphocytes from passive smokers, and patients with FA, Alz, or FPC were studied  for SCEs in cultures treated with MMC, 4NQO, or MNNG. Fanconi anemia lymphocytes were also studied for cell cycle Tab. 3. Mean SCE frequencies in FPC or normal cells. (Table; see text) kinetics, and CAs after completion of 1, 2, or 3 or more divisions in MMC treated cultures. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) lymphocytes from passive smokers showed a slightly higher induction of SCEs than nonsmokers when exposed to MMC. (2) FA cells had about 1.4 times higher frequencies of SCEs than normal cells in both MMC treated and untreated cultures while they showed several times higher frequencies of CAs in both cultures. Analyses of cell cycle kinetics by the sister chromatid differential staining method revealed that MMC treatments of FA and normal cells led to a clearly dose related delay in cell turnover times, the duration of delay being much longer in FA than in normal cells. (3) Alz cells showed about 1.5 times higher induction of SCEs in MMC treated cultures whereas they had only 10% as much SCEs as controls when exposed to 4NQO. Familial polyposis coli cells showed no significant difference in the induction of SCEs in untreated cultures and cultures treated with MMC, 4NQO, and MNNG.
