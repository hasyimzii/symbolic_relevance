Extensive loss of choline acetyltransferase activity is not reflected by neuronal loss in the nucleus of Meynert in Alzheimer's disease.
Choline acetyltransferase activity in discrete tissue punches from the nucleus of Meynert and in tissue from the temporal cortex was reduced by at least 90% and 75%, respectively, in 5 out of 6 elderly cases of Alzheimer's disease compared with 5 normal cases. In contrast, estimates of neurone density in these same cases revealed that there was only, on average, a 33% neurone loss in the nucleus of Meynert in Alzheimer's disease. These observations suggest that a key pathological change in Alzheimer's disease may be the 'down regulation' of transmitter specific enzyme production in cholinergic neurones, and that neurone loss itself may be a secondary feature of the disease.
