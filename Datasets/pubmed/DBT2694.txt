Measurement of serum C peptide immunoreactivity by radioimmunoassay in insulin dependent diabetics.
A radioimmunoassay for C peptide utilizing synthetic C peptide as an antigen and  tyrosylated synthetic C peptide for iodination was evaluated for its clinical use. Mean fasting C peptide levels in 24 normal subjects was 2.6 +/  0.8 ng/ml. During the oral glucose tolerance test, baseline C peptide in five normal subjects was 1.5 +/  0.8 ng/ml, and at 60 min was 5.6 +/  1.6 ng/ml. For two insulin dependent diabetic patients, diagnoses of factitious hypoglycemia were documented on the basis of simultaneous free insulin and C peptide determinations. Sera from 24 insulin dependent diabetics were analyzed for free and total immunoreactive C peptide and insulin levels. For 20% of juvenile and 64% of maturity onset diabetics, the presence of proinsulin like material bound to insulin antibodies was demonstrated by measurement in unextracted serum. This accounted for 20% to 100% of total C peptide immunoreactivity in these patients. Simple polyethylene glycol precipitation of immune complexes and the measurement of free immunoreactive C peptide in the supernatant demonstrated subnormal levels (less than 0.5 ng/ml) in all juvenile diabetics and normal levels (1.8 +/  1.3 ng/ml) in 70% of maturity onset diabetics.
