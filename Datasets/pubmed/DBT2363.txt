Factors affecting plasma beta thromboglobulin in diabetes mellitus.
Plasma beta thromboglobulin, hemoglobin A1c and serum creatinine were measured in 56 diabetic patients. Patients with diabetic complications had a significantly higher beta thromboglobulin level than the controls, but patients without complications did not differ from the controls. beta Thromboglobulin correlated positively with serum creatinine and the highest values were encountered in patients with abnormal creatinine concentration. There were, however, patients with normal creatinine but high plasma beta thromboglobulin levels. In these patients the abnormal beta thromboglobulin level most probably indicates undue stimulation of platelets. There was no correlation between beta thromboglobulin and hemoglobin A1c.
