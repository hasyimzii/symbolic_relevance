Treatment of chronic hepatitis B with lymphoblastoid alpha interferon.
Thirty five patients with active chronic hepatitis B (ACH B) were evaluated. They were in stable replicative phase (HBeAg +; DNA polymerase and ALT stable in two determinations at least one month apart) and had not been infected by delta virus or HIV 1. Thirty four patients were heterosexual and no patient was a drug abuser except one. The 23 initial cases were followed up for 15 months without therapy. The subsequent 12 cases were treated with maximal doses of 2.5 megaunits/m2 of lymphoblastoid alpha interferon (IFN L) daily for two weeks and three times a week during 10 more weeks. While in the controls only two cases (8.69%) lost the DNA polymerase activity and HBeAg, 5 treated patients (41.66%; p less than 0.05) developed seroconversion to nonreplicative phase. No patient from the control series lost the HBsAg; however, this happened in 2 treated patients (16.66%). These results show that IFN L is effective in heterosexual patients with ACH B in replicative phase without delta virus or HIV I co infection.
