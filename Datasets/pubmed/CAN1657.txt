Histological grading of hydatidiform mole (author's transl).
This study was performed to seek possibility of selecting the high risk group in  the patients with hydatidiform mole at its delivery. The histologic specimens from 83 patients with hydatidiform mole were reviewed and classified by modified Hertig's grading. Lymphocyte count of peripheral blood was also studied as an immunological index. I. There were 36 Grade I cases, 16 Grade IIa, 23 Grade IIb, and 8 Grade III cases. Two subsequent destructive moles were found from the patients with Grade I, three from Grade IIb, and two from Grade III respectively. The incidence of developing subsequent destructive mole was 6% in Grade I, 8% in Grade II, and 25% in Grade III. II. There was no correlation between histological grading and patients age nor weeks in gestation. When the ratio of syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast was considered, most of Grade II or III cases were obtained from those in whom the cytotrophoblast prevailed over syncytiotrophoblast. III. The patients with lymphocyte less than 1500/mm3 in their peripheral blood were apt to take abnormal clinical course comparing to those with lymphocyte more than 1501/mm3. The more accurate prediction of clinical course was suggested by combination of histological grading and lymphocyte count.
