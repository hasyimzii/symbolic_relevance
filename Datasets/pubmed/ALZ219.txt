Fluctuations of free choline levels in plasma of Alzheimer patients receiving lecithin: preliminary observations.
Plasmas of 12 patients currently taking part in a double blind trial of lecithin  in senile or presenile dementia of Alzheimer type were analysed for plasma choline levels at fixed intervals during lecithin treatment. The values were not maintained at a constant level and showed a decline after one or two months of treatment, often followed by a subsequent rise. Possible explanations for this observation are given, and its significance to the treatment of dementia discussed.
