Neuropsychological analysis of Alzheimer's disease.
Neuropsychological analysis, which aims at establishing correlations between mental disorders and alterations in one or several functional cerebral structures, cannot be performed at the dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease. From the nature and variety of the mental disorders observed it may be hypothesized that the disease does not involve one single biochemical system (cholinergic theory) but several systems of neurotransmitters, each of which plays a specific role in man's mental activities.
