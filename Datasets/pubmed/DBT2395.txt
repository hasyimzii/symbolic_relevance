Chlorpropamide alcohol flushing is not useful for individual genetic counseling of diabetic patients.
The presence or absence of chlorpropamide alcohol flushing (CPAF) was not correlated with the classification of diabetes. Five out of twelve patients with juvenile onset diabetes (JOD) flushed and three out of four patients with maturity onset diabetes in young people (MODY) did not flush. Consequently, CPAF cannot be used for individual genetic counseling in diabetes mellitus.
