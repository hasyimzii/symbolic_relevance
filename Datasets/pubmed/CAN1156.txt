Small cell carcinoma of the lung: a five year experience with combined modality therapy.
In the past five years, we have treated 89 patients with small cell carcinoma of  the lung with radiotherapy plus one of three chemotherapy programs. The 24 patients with disease confined to the chest (Stage IIIMO) had an 87% response rate to the combined modalities (79% complete responses) and a median survival of 18 months; 13 patients with disease confined to the chest and ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes (Stage IIIMOSCN +) had an 84% response rate (69% complete responses) and 11 month median survival; the 52 patients with distant metastases (Stage IIIMI) had a 71% response rate (15% complete responses) and eight month median survival. Survival was not affected by adding prophylactic cranial irradiation to the latest regimen, although the CNS relapse rate was reduced. We conclude that our three chemotherapy programs to date differ very little in their effect on survival of patients with metastatic disease. New and more vigorous approaches, possibly including surgery, need to be tested for the management of disease confined to the chest. The designation of patients as Stage IIIMOSCN + is valid because such patients have better survival rates than patients with distant metastatic disease.
