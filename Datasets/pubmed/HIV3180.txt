The AIDS virus as an opportunistic organism inducing a state of chronic relative  cortisol excess: therapeutic implications.
The AIDS virus is an opportunistic organism which requires a previously immunocompromised host for successful replication. We propose that the primary and as yet unlocalized lesion caused by the AIDS virus involves disruption of physiologically balanced responses to stressors, effectively creating a state of chronic relative cortisol excess. Such a state inhibits successful anti pathogen strategies including those directed against the AIDS virus itself and leads to a self sustaining downhill clinical course. Therapies based on this model are discussed.
