Renal failure in diabetes after intravenous urography.
A review of the literature reveals that patients with juvenile onset diabetes with azotemia, associated vascular disease, and proteinuria, are at great risk of sustaining acute renal failure following intravenous pyelography. Predisposing factors are identified, but the exact mechanism of acute renal failure remains obscure. Since no prophylactic measures or effective treatment exist, the benefits and risk must be weighed prior to the procedure.
