Clostridium perfringens wound infection associated with elastic bandages.
Clostridium perfringens wound infections were associated with the use of nonsterile elastic outer bandages in diabetic patients who had undergone lower extremity amputation for vascular insufficiency. In each case a second surgical procedure was required. Elastic bandages similar to those used in these procedures were found to contain C perfringens and other clostridial species. This report illustrates the need for maintenance of a sterile, nonpermeable inner barrier to prevent transudation of bacteria into the wound and the potential benefit of using sterile elastic outer bandages after amputation for vascular insufficiency.
