Carcinoma of the prostate in childhood and adolescence: report of a case and review of the literature.
This paper reports a case of carcinoma of the prostate in an 11 year old boy. The clinical findings were characterized by a mass in the prostatic region, extensive osteoblastic bone metastasis, and normal serum acid phosphatase. Autopsy demonstrated an undifferentiated tumor, which probably originated from the outer gland of the prostate. Metastases to the bones, liver, lungs, and the lymph nodes were present. Light and electron microscopic studies revealed undifferentiated neoplastic cell, which is in contrast to the usual adenocarcinoma in older individuals. Histochemical examination failed to demonstrate acid phosphatase activity within the tumor cells. The authors considered that this tumor probably originated from immature basal cells of the prostatic gland. Review of the literature disclosed 15 cases of carcinoma of the prostate in individuals under 21 years of age. These cases were also characterized by an undifferentiated appearance of tumor cells and normal serum acid phosphatase level.
