Experience with the EEA stapler in colon anastomosis.
On the basis of 35 resections of the sigma of low anterior resections of the rectum, the outcome of conventional (13) and EEA stapler (22) anastomoses is analysed. The incidence of clinical or radiological insufficiencies is significantly lower in stapler anastomoses. Technical details important for a successful stapling procedure and the outcome of the anastomosis are discussed. The importance of the control for completeness of the tissue rings after removal of the purse string suture is stressed. Regarding these technical details stapler anastomoses have proven to facilitate very low anterior rectal resections and to achieve less postoperative complications.
