Diabetic heart disease.
The fact that a significant proportion of diabetics die of heart disease has led  to the belief that the excess mortality is due to coronary athersclerosis, yet many risk factors for the latter are common to diabetics and non diabetics. In fact, heart disease in diabetes is not synonymous with coronary heart disease. There is evidence that heart disease in diabetes includes a variable combination of coronary atheroma, cardiomyopathy, micro angiopathy and autonomioc neuropathy.
