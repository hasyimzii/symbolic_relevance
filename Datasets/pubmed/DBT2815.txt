The metabolic and hormonal responses to glucose infusion in anaesthetized normal  and diabetic dogs controlled by an artificial B cell.
The metabolic response to glucose infusion in anaesthetized normal and pancreatectomized dogs has been assessed. Normoglycaemia was achieved in the diabetic dogs with an external artificial B cell which administered insulin into the peripheral circulation. No differences were found in the levels of blood glucose, glucagon, lactate, pyruvate and plasma non esterified fatty acids, either in the fasting state or in response to glucose infusion. However, compared to normal animals normoglycaemic diabetic dogs had significantly elevated circulating levels of insulin and alanine at all times. Fasting levels of the same hormones and metabolites were also measured in conscious dogs. Blood pyruvate levels were higher, and plasma non esterified fatty acid levels lower, in the anaesthetized animals. There were also minor but consistent changes in blood glucose and plasma insulin while glucagon, lactate and alanine levels were unaffected by anaesthesia. In conclusion, controlled barbiturate anaesthesia has relatively minor effects on the metabolic and hormonal status of the dog. The metabolic and hormonal response to glucose infusion in pancreatectomized dogs treated with an artificial B cell was almost entirely normalized, except for peripheral hyperinsulinaemia and hyperalaninaemia.
