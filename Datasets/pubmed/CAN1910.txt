The isolated fourth ventricle in children: CT and clinical review of 16 cases.
Isolated fourth ventricles were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) in 16 children in a 3 year period. They all had had shunting of the lateral ventricles for hydrocephalus, and all needed subsequent shunt revisions. Seven patients without signs of raised intracranial pressure clinically had new posterior fossa signs at different intervals after lateral ventricular shunting. The clinical findings in the other nine patients were much less specific and in some cases the isolated fourth ventricle was an incidental finding. CT is essential for the diagnosis. The isolated fourth ventricle needs to be differentiated from posterior fossa cysts and cystic tumors. Shunting of the fourth ventricle improved the clinical condition in six of 14 children.
