Immunoglobulins, cognitive status and duration of illness in alzheimer's disease.
Immunologic changes have been reported in the dementing illnesses of mid and late life. The results of two studies of drug free males meeting research diagnostic criteria for primary neuronal degeneration of the Alzheimer's type suggest that serum IgG levels decrease with the progression of dementia. Serum IgG levels were inversely correlated with duration of illness and the levels of psychiatric symptomatology. Performance on the mini mental status examination was positively associated with serum IgG concentrations.
