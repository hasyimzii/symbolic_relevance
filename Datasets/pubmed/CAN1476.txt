Differences in the metabolism of 12 O 3Htetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate and 3Hphorbol 12,13 didecanoate by cells in culture.
The metabolism of the tumor promoters 120 O [3H]tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate ([3H]TPA) and [3H]phorbol 12,13 didecanoate ([3H]PDD) was analyzed in several cell types in culture. In contrast to the rapid metabolism of [3H]TPA, [3H]PDD was degraded much more slowly in hamster, rat, chick, and mouse fibroblasts. Human fibroblasts did not significantly metabolize either phorbol diester over a three day period. In hamster fibroblasts, addition of increasing amounts of nonradioactive TPA inhibited the metabolism of [3H]TPA, while a 100 fold excess of PDD had no effect on [3H]TPA metabolism. Primary cultures of hamster epidermal cells, a long term epidermal cell line, and a hamster preadipose cell line rapidly metabolized [3H]TPA but only slowly metabolized [3H]PDD. In contrast to human fibroblasts, a human hepatoma cell line metabolized [3H]TPA, but these cells metabolized [3H]PDD much more slowly. The profile of metabolites produced from [3H]PDD was studied in two cell types. In hamster cells, the major metabolite produced was [3H]phorbol 12 decanoate while in BALB/c 3T3 cells, approximately equal amounts of [3H]phorbol 12 decanoate and [3H]phorbol 13 decanoate were produced. When tested for biological activity in cell culture, phorbol 13 decanoate was 17 to 40 times less active than PDD as measured by the induction of ornithine decarboxylase in hamster cells and the stimulation of 2 deoxyglucose uptake in BALB/c 3T3 cells. Phorbol 12 decanoate was virtually inactive in both assays.
