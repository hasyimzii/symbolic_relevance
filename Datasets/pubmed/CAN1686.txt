Gardner syndrome: apropos of 3 families and 7 cases.
Gardner's syndrome, an hereditary affection of the different blastoderm layers, is rarely recognised, even though it is seen in 8 16% of cases of colorectal polyposis. The authors present 7 cases of Gardner's syndrome within 3 families: 4 female and 3 male. Six of the patients belonged to 2 families, of which several members suffered from familial polyposis; the seventh case was an isolated case of Gardner's syndrome, without a family history of polyposis. Because of the high risk of malignancy in the presence of polyps, the treatment of Gardner's syndrome is identical to that of familial polyposis, 4 patients underwent total colectomy, 2 a simple polypectomy and 1 refused all treatment or monitoring. From these patients, one of the polyps excised at the level of the rectum was found to be undergoing malignant transformation. The extra colic manifestations of this condition precede the polyposis within the gut; they attract attention and thus permit an early diagnosis.
