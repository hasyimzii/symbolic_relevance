Synthetic peptides as substrates and inhibitors of human immune deficiency virus 1 protease.
Retroviruses code for a virus specific protease which is essential for polyprotein processing and viral infectivity. The human immune deficiency virus 1 protease is an aspartic protease of 9 kDa which was synthesized by recombinant DNA technology and arises by autocatalytic processing from a polyprotein precursor which has recently been demonstrated by use of a protease specific monoclonal antibody. The protease was shown to form dimers. Here we demonstrate that synthetic peptides can be used as both model substrates as well as inhibitors for investigation of the protease. 14 synthetic peptides, 7 18 amino acids in length, containing putative protease cleavage sites of the viral polyprotein gag and pol precursors, have been analyzed with the partially purified protease by the use of high performance liquid chromatography. In seven cases, where cleavage was observed, the length of the peptides did not significantly influence the cleavage efficiencies, heptapeptides being large enough as model substrates. No cleavage was observed with a protein preparation purified in parallel from control bacteria not expressing the human immune deficiency virus 1 protease. The protease was not only able to cut next to a proline but also between other peptides indicating that the proline is not a prerequisite. Three peptides with either reduced bonds at the cleavage site or a substitution by statin were inhibitory while another uncleaved substrate was not. The usefulness of small model substrates for characterization of the protease is further demonstrated by determination of a kinetic optimum pH (3.5 5.5) and incubation temperature (37 degrees C).
