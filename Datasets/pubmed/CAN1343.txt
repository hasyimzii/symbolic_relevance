Tumour of the ovary after hysterectomy (author's transl).
Between 1962 and 1973 vaginal or abdominal hysterectomies were done in 1811 women at the University women clinic Tubingen. In all cases the adnexa were preserved. Malignancies of the uterus were not present in these cases. Until 1978 41 patients were reoperated because of ovarian tumours. They developed 5 to 130 months after hysterectomy. Benign or even praemalignant lesions of the uterus did not have an influence on the frequency of later development of an ovarian tumor. The frequency of a second laparotomy was significantly higher in cases with a myoma of the uterus when compared with other histological changes of the uterus (p < 0,05). After vaginal hysterectomy ovarian tumours occurred less frequently. Among 41 reoperated cases four ovarian carcinomas were found: a frequency of 0,22%. Based upon the data of these investigations no recommendation can be given regarding the age limit for ovariectomy at the time of hysterectomy for prophylaxis of ovarian cancer.
