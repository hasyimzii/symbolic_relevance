Alzheimer's disease: isoproterenol and prostaglandin E1 stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in lymphocytes.
Reduced lymphocyte beta adrenergic receptor activity was observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in aged controls; a parallel decline in lymphocytic prostaglandin E1 receptor activity was seen in the aged controls. In the Alzheimer patients, however, such lymphocytic prostaglandin E1 receptor activity was significantly raised and correlated with a rating scale for severity of dementia.
