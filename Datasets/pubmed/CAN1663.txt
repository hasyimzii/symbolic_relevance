Preoperative radiotherapy of hypernephroma (author's transl).
Postoperative radiotherapy shows significant improvement in the treatment of hypernephroma. Short term preoperative radiotherapy seems to further improve the results. Experimental work demonstrated a reduction or even complete failure to form colonies in hypernephroma cells, which had been exposed to radiation. Clinical studies at present at least indicate a positive trend for short term preoperative radiotherapy.
