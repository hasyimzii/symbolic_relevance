Determinants of primary care optometry.
The frequency with which visual problems, ocular disease, and ocular manifestations of systemic disease are experienced in private optometric practice are the determinants of optometry as a primary care profession. This paper describes the basic optometric services provided and shows that these services identify optometry as a primary care profession. A problem oriented clinical record indicates by color coding the presence of the conditions diagnosed. A computer number assigned to each coded condition and programmed into the system facilitates data retrieval. The color coded charts provide ready access for review of specific conditions, whereas the computer permits analysis of data concerning the frequency of each of the identified condition.
