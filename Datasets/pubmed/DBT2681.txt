Microcirculation disturbances at the onset of diabetic retinopathy. New therapeutic procedures? (author's transl).
The generalized capillary dilatation demonstrable at the early stage of diabetic  retinopathy can now, on the basis of recent results in biochemistry, be assessed as an attempt at autoregulation in relative hypoxia of tissue. In patients with diabetic retinopathy, an elevated HbA1c concentration in the blood can be observed. The DPG level, however, is reduced. Both facts cause reduced oxygen
