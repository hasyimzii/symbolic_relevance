Retinopathy after tilorone hydrochloride.
Two patients, a 34 year old woman and a 50 year old woman, received tilorone HCl, an experimental antitumor drug. After taking the drug orally (total dose, 152 g), the first patient developed corneal subepithelial infiltrates and toxic retinopathy characterized by fine pigment mottling of the peripheral fundus and macula with mild arteriolar narrowing. Although visual acuity was 6/6 (20/20) throughout treatment, Goldmann perimetry showed marked peripheral constriction of the visual fields and results of an electroretinogram and an electro oculogram were abnormal. After taking the drug orally (total dose, 189 g), the second patient developed corneal subepithelial infiltrates, severe bilateral arteriolar narrowing, and mild pigment mottling of the macula. ERG and EOG were moderately attenuated. Visual fields by Goldman perimetry were within normal limits. Tilorone HCl, like chloroquine, may be an antioxidant that affects the free radical scavenging mechanism of the retinal pigment epithelium. Extensive testing should be done on all patients taking tilorone HCl in order to detect the initial manifestations of retinopathy.
