The stimulus secretion coupling of amino acid induced insulin release: metabolism and cationic effects of leucine.
When isolated rat pancreatic islets are exposed to L leucine (20 mM), the rate of NH4 production is close to the summed rates of L [1 14C] leucine decarboxylation and alpha ketoisocarproate production, whereas the rates of acetoacetate production and L [U 14C] leucine oxidation are compatible with conversion of each mole of the amino acid to one mole of acetoacetate and three moles of CO2. ATP content, ATP/ADP ratio, and adenylate charge are maintained at normal values by L leucine, whereas the NADH/NAD+ ratio (but not the NADPH/NADP+ ratio) is significantly increased. The release of insulin evoked by L leucine is potentiated by 2 ketoisovalerate, unaffected by L valine, and inhibited by menadione. L leucine mimicks the effect of D glucose on 86Rb+ and 45Ca2+ handling by the islets. However, relative to its rate of oxidation, the insulinotropic effect of L leucine is less marked than that of D glucose. This may be due, in part at least, to a decrease in the oxidation of endogenous nutrients. It is concluded that the metabolic, cationic, and secretory effects of L leucine in isolated islets are not incompatible with the fuel hypothesis for insulin release.
