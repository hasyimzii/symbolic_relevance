Effects of EMG biofeedback on diabetes.
A case is described in which a juvenile onset insulin requiring diabetic was given frontalis EMG biofeedback. For 6 years prior to biofeedback training, the subject had been healthy and stable on 22 24 units regular insulin injected once daily. During 8 weeks of standard feedback training for relaxation of frontalis muscle activity, the subject twice reduced her daily insulin dosages. At the end of 8 weeks, the subject was receiving 17 18 units regular insulin daily but was still unstable, sometimes being hyperglycemic, sometimes hypoglycemic. Because of disturbing symptoms associated with this instability, biofeedback was discontinued for 6 months, at which time the subject was again healthy and stable on the equivalent of 18 19 units regular insulin daily. After this period, biofeedback was again given for 1 week, but the subject again became highly unstable and biofeedback was permanently stopped. Caution is suggested when dealing with diabetic patients.
