Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare tumor that arises from the olfactory mucosa and presents usually as a mass in the nasal cavity. Neurological complications occur in about 20% of these cases. Nine cases have been recorded so far in which the neoplasm manifested initially as an intracranial mass. These cases are reviewed and another patient, presenting with progressive unilateral visual loss, is reported.
