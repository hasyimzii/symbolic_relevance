Anti class II antibodies in AIDS patients and AIDS risk groups.
The specificity of anti lymphocyte antibodies was evaluated in AIDS patients and  in individuals at risk of AIDS [R AIDS: male homosexuals (Ho) and haemophiliacs (He)]. Antibodies capable of inducing antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against non T cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines (P3HR 1K and Raji) were detected in AIDS patients and in R AIDS with positive or negative human immune deficiency virus (HIV) serology. Anti class II antigen specificity was revealed by experiments in which class II antigens on target cells were blocked with monoclonal anti class II antibody (DA6,231) and the cytotoxic reaction induced by patient's sera was abolished. In contrast, ADCC was not impaired by preincubating the target cells with anti class I monoclonal antibody (W6/32). Prevalence of antibodies to non T cells was confirmed by standard C mediated microlymphocytotoxicity. However, with this technique anti T lymphocyte cytotoxicity was also observed in three AIDS patients with haemophilia. R AIDS peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were also cytotoxic against autologous non T cells, and lysis was slightly increased by sensitization of the target cells with autologous serum. In addition to ADCC and C mediated cytotoxicity, the specificity of anti lymphocyte antibodies was assayed by their ability to interfere the binding of fluorescein labelled anti class II (HLA DR) and anti class I (W6/32) monoclonal antibodies to PBMC, non T cells, P3HR 1K and Raji. Anti class II specificity was confirmed, and antibody titres tended to be higher in Ho than in He R AIDS, using non T cells and Raji as targets. Higher titres of anti class II antibodies in the Ho group could play a role in the different susceptibility of HIV infected Ho when compared to HIV (+) He to develop AIDS.
