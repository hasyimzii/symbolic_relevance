Hyperbilirubinemia in infants of diabetic mothers.
Large for gestational age (LGA) infants of insulin dependent diabetic mothers (IDM), appropriate for gestational age (AGA) IDM, and infants of nondiabetic mothers were compared for the incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and related etiologic factors. At 60 hours of age, LGA IDM had significantly higher serum bilirubin concentrations (12.3 +/  2.1 mg/100 ml) than AGA IDM (7.6 +/  3.9 mg/100 ml) or control infants (7.8 +/  2.8 mg/100 ml) (P < .001). Peak serum bilirubin concentrations were also significantly higher in LGA IDM (14.4 +/  2.1 mg/100 ml) than in AGA IDM (8.4 +/  3.7 mg/100ml) or control infants (8.6 +/  3.3 mg/100 ml) (P < .001). Mean percent of carboxyhemoglobin was used as an indicator of hemolysis and showed a significant elevation in LGA IDM (1.51 +/  0.19) when compared to AGA IDM (1.10 +/  0.27) and control infants (1.19 +/  0.33) (P < .05). No significant differences were found among the three groups with respect to mode of delivery, frequency of pitocin administration, 5 minute Apgar scores, incidence of isoimmunization, incidence of enclosed hemorrhage, hemoglobin concentration, bilirubin concentrations at 12 hours, and percent of weight loss. Our data suggest that only LGA IDM are at increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia and that increased heme turnover is a significant factor in the pathogenesis.
