Maturation index: a contribution to quantification in the FAB classification of acute leukaemia.
The French  American  British co operative study group (FAB) criteria were used to classify acute leukaemia in 194 adult patients. The dividing lines between FAB subgroups M1  M2 and M5A  M5B appeared to be less well defined. In an effort to improve subtyping we introduce the maturation index (MI). (formula: see text). Clearly distinct subgroups emerged after arrangement of cases according to MI values. Immature and rather mature cases in both myeloblastic and monoblastic leukaemia were divided at a MI of 4%. Assignment to M3, which is based essentially on morphological grounds, could be made on numerical grounds too, MI being at least 85% in all of our cases. A few cases showing M2 morphology and a positive alpha naphthylacetate esterase (ANE) staining should probably be categorized as M4. Application of the original FAB criteria resulted in disagreement of 14% between three investigators, while with our additional criteria the discrepancy was only 2%.
