Practical guidelines for the antemortem diagnosis of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
SDAT is the most common type of dementia in the elderly but is difficult to diagnose antemortem. The clinical assessment gives a 80% accuracy of diagnosis. 18F DG is currently the best imaging technique for the diagnosis of SDAT in vivo. A cortical biopsy with histology and assay of CAT is required to give a diagnosis of definite SDAT.
