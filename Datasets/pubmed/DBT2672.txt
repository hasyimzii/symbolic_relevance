Serum lipoproteins in diabetes: relation of alpha lipoprotein level to therapy.
Three hundred and sixty diabetic patients (125 on insulin, 109 on sulfonylureas and 126 on diet alone) were selected to investigate the effect of the type of treatment and of the degree of metabolic control on serum lipoproteins. Prebeta lipoprotein concentration was higher than normal in all treatment groups. Beta lipoproteins were significantly higher in diabetic women than in controls. No difference in beta  and prebeta lipoprotein concentration existed between the 3 treatment groups. Alpha lipoproteins were significantly higher in insulin treated than in diet treated patients irrespective of the degree of metabolic control. The daily dose of insulin and, in patients on diet or sulfonylureas, serum IRI were positively correlated to alpha lipoprotein concentration while this lipoprotein fraction was not significantly correlated to fasting blood sugar. Alpha lipoprotein concentration, then, appears to be markedly influenced by exogenous and endogenous insulin, independently of the degree of metabolic control.
