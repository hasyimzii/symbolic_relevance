A comprehensive treatment program for severely impaired geriatric patients.
Many elderly patients have psychiatric and medical needs that are not met by the  traditional care offered at state hospitals, acute psychiatric services, or nursing homes. At Garfield Geropsychiatric Hospital, a program of intensive evaluation and multidisciplinary treatment that emphasizes rehabilitation has been successful in maintaining or restoring independent functioning for severely impaired geriatric patients. The program also benefits the mental health system by reducing the inappropriate use of state hospital and acute psychiatric services, and by providing a first important step toward a comprehensive network of mental health services for the elderly.
