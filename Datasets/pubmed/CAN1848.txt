Significance of Ph1 negative marrow cells in Ph1 positive chronic granulocytic leukemia.
Fifty six of 195 Ph1 positive patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia were found to have Ph1 negative metaphases in marrow aspirates on one or more occasions. In 22 cases, Ph1 negative cells were found prior to initiation of antileukemic therapy. Five patients were in the blastic stage of the disease when Ph1 negative mitoses were seen. The finding of Ph1 negative cells appeared to be related principally to short duration of CGL and to administration of antileukemic therapy (conventional agents and doses, in most cases). Ph1 negative cells were usually not found more than 2 yr after the diagnosis of leukemia, but in a few cases, they were seen as long as 5 10 yr after diagnosis. Only a minority of metaphases analyzed were Ph1 negative, except in the case of 6 patients who transiently had 50% or more Ph1 negative cells after antileukemic therapy. The presence of Ph1 negative cells in marrow was not associated with any survival advantage in this series.
