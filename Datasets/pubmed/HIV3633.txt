Long term culture and fine specificity of human cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones reactive with human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
The definition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) immunogenic epitopes is central to the rational design of AIDS vaccine strategies. In this study, we have generated seven HIV 1 reverse transcriptase specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones from the peripheral blood of two seropositive subjects. Epitopes recognized by these CTL clones were identified by using target cells infected with recombinant HIV 1 vaccinia virus vectors expressing truncated reverse transcriptase proteins and further defined by using target cells incubated with overlapping 25 amino acid synthetic reverse transcriptase peptides. Five different CTL epitopes were identified, and in each case recognition was restricted by class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Clones maintained specific cytolytic function in continuous culture for up to 11 months, requiring only periodic restimulation with a CD3 specific monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that HIV 1 specific, major histocompatibility class I restricted CTL recognize multiple epitopes of a single viral gene product in conjunction with different host HLA antigens. In addition, they demonstrate that human virus specific CTL can be grown in long term culture without the need for reexposure to viral antigen.
