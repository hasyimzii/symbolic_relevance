Intradermal testing with multiple recall antigens for identification of cell mediated immune deficiency in homosexual men.
In a health screening project for gay men in Stockholm, delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity was tested in 710 men by a commercial kit (Multitest, Merieux) containing seven recall antigens and related to past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, various life style factors, the lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS), and antibodies to human T lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III). The multiscore (MS: the sum of all positive reactions) was significantly decreased in men with the following characteristics: HBV markers, greater than 50 yearly sexual partners, regular practice of receptive rectal intercourse, regular sex in gay bathhouses, recent sexual encounters in the US, greater than 50 lifetime exposures to inhaled nitrates, LAS, and positive HTLV III serology. Anergy to tuberculin (TU) but not to any other antigen was more common in men with greater than 20 yearly partners, regular practice of receptive rectal intercourse, exposure to inhalant nitrates, LAS as well as lesser degree of lymphadenopathy, and HTLV III seropositivity. HTLV III antibodies were demonstrated in 61 of 416 (14.7%) men. During the 2 year follow up four men have developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome. All four had MS less than 10 mm and TU anergy. In a BCG immunized population Multitest only adds marginal information as compared to intradermal testing solely with TU, but may yield prognostic information in evaluating HTLV III positive individuals with respect to development of manifest AIDS.
