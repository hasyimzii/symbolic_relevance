Splenectomy in children in Hong Kong.
A review of the hospital course of 82 splenectomies in children performed in the  past 15 years has been carried out. Three indications have been identified: therapeutic, diagnostic, and traumatic. Thalassemia was identified as the commonest indication. Comparisons of the spleens removed showed that those from thalassaemia patients were the biggest, while those removed for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), lymphoma staging, and trauma, were small. Twenty eight per cent of patients had accessory spleens. Intrathoracic complications were frequent in the traumatic cases, whereas wound complications were commoner after splenectomies carried out for haematological reasons. No gallstones were detected. The platelet response to the various indications was studied and compared. There were two postoperative deaths.
