Possibilities of longterm monitoring of metabolic diseases (author's transl).
The measurement of glycolysed hemoglobin as a parameter of longterm monitoring has considerably enlarged the scope of possibilities for diabetic supervision. Retrospective information on the quality of the metabolic stabilization up to three months is possible, independently of the momentary blood sugar. Analyses of fatty tissue permit conclusions on the fat composition of the diet in the past years, the fatty acid pattern of the cholesterol esters are an indicator for the ingestion of unsaturated fatty acids in the last few weeks. No practicable method for longterm monitoring of purine metabolism has yet been developed. The size of the uric acid pool may be such a parameter.
