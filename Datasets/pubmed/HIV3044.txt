Serological evidence for virus related to simian T lymphotropic retrovirus III in residents of west Africa.
Serological evidence is presented here suggesting that a virus closely related to simian T lymphotropic virus type III (STLV III) infects man in Senegal, west Africa, a region where AIDS or AIDS related diseases have not yet been observed. 25 sera from Senegalese individuals that were positive for antibodies to HTLV III by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were examined for antibodies to HTLV III and STLV III by western blotting. Sera from individuals originating from regions where AIDS has been reported, such as the United States and Burundi (central Africa), reacted best with antigens of HTLV III, although antibodies that cross reacted with STLV III p24 were also detected. Conversely, sera originating from Senegalese people reacted better with STLV III than with HTLV III. This was exemplified by the absence of reactivity in sera from both monkeys and Senegalese people to p41, an antigen regularly detected by sera from antibody positive individuals originating from central Africa or from the United States. In contrast sera from central Africa or the United States did not react with p32, the putative envelope transmembrane protein of STLV III that is regularly detected by sera from both monkeys and antibody positive Senegalese people. These results suggest that certain healthy Senegalese people have been exposed to a virus that is more closely related to STLV III than to HTLV III. The existence and study of such virus variants potentially with differential pathogenicity may provide important information for the development of an AIDS virus vaccine.
