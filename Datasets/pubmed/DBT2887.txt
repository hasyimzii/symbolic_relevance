Alterations in labeling of cell surface glycoproteins from normal and diabetic rat intestinal microvillous membranes.
The effect of chronic streptozotocin induced diabetes was studied on intestinal microvillous membrane surface carbohydrate groups. After 7 weeks of diabetes, purified microvillous membranes were prepared from rat small intestine and surface galactoproteins identified by labeling with galactose oxidase/sodium boro[3H]hydride. Membrane surface sialic acid residues were labeled using the sodium metaperiodate/sodium boro[3H]hydride technique. Membranes were solubilized in SDS and protein labeling analyzed by acrylamide electrophoresis. Membranes from diabetic rats showed an 81% increase in galactoprotein labeling (P less than 0.02) while labeling of sialic acid residues was unchanged. The greatest increase in galactoprotein labeling occurred in protein monomers of Mr 116,000 200,000, where there was a 155% increase in labeling (P less than 0.005). These results indicate that intestinal microvillous membrane protein glycosylation is altered in chronic diabetes. This increase in surface membrane carbohydrates could explain the decreased rates of proteolytic degradation previously described for at least one microvillous protein. An increase in membrane galactose groups has also been noted in hepatocyte and kidney glomerular basement membranes, which suggests the presence of a systematic change in membrane protein glycosylation occurring as a result of the diabetic state.
