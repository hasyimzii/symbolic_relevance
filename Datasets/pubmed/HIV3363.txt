Enhanced in vitro inhibition of HIV 1 replication by 3' fluoro 3' deoxythymidine  compared to several other nucleoside analogs.
Nucleoside analogs were synthesized and tested for anti HIV 1 activity in two in  vitro test systems using MT 4 cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Cytotoxicity was assessed in both assays and additionally in several human lymphoblastoid cell lines. One analog, 3' fluoro 3' deoxythymidine, exhibited higher antiviral potency and slightly higher cytotoxicity than 3' azido 3' deoxythymidine. Analogs showing lower cytotoxicity than 3' azido 3' deoxythymidine demonstrated reduced antiviral activity. 3' fluoro 3' deoxythymidine may become an alternative chemotherapeutic agent because of its high antiretroviral potency. Its toxicity, however, deserves further investigation.
