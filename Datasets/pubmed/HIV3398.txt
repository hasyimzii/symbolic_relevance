Increased detection of human immunodeficiency virus antigen carriers by simultaneous assay of plasma and extracts from resting and phytohaemagglutinin stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Antigenaemia due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is thought to be significant either before the appearance of a specific antibody response, or after its decline during terminal stages. In order to increase the rate of detection of HIV antigen carriers, regardless of the stage or despite the presence of specific serum antibodies, we assayed, simultaneously, plasma samples and extracts from resting and phytohaemagglutinin stimulated mononuclear cells from 25 infected, anti body positive individuals and 10 healthy, antibody negative female volunteer blood donors. We detected the presence of HIV antigen in at least one of the three types of specimens obtained from all the 25 infected subjects but in none of the 10 healthy blood donors. This approach might prove most useful for the study of patients with controversial or equivocal antibody test results.
