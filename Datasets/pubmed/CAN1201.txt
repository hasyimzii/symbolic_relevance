Diffuse polypoid lipomatosis coli with hypertrophy of the appendices epiploicae  in congenital lipomatosis (author's transl).
In a 62 year old patient diffuse polypoid lipomatosis of the colon and hypertrophy of the appendices epiploicae was found together with subcutaneous lipomata and bone changes. Out of the five cases of diffuse lipomatosis coli published so far certain parallels can be drawn in only one case. The clinical picture and course indicate that it is either a pathogenetically uniform form of mesenchymal dysplasia or a syndrome.
