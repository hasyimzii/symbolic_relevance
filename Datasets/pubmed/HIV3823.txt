HIV infection risk to health care workers.
The risk of occupationally acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection  in exposed health care workers has been estimated to be 0.5% after accidental needlestick with an HIV contaminated needle. Needlestick injuries resulting in parenteral exposure to HIV infected material are the most common reported cause of occupational HIV infection in health care workers. With 60% of these exposures unpreventable even with strict adherence to current infection control procedures, it is necessary to develop technical changes in work protection in order to further reduce the risk.
