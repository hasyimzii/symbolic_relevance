Diabetic glomerulosclerosis: current status of its morphology and pathogenesis (author's transl).
The diabetic glomerulosclerosis as a consequence of the abnormal metabolic state  is characterized by an uniform thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and an augmentation of the mesangial matrix. Both alterations begin already few years after the onset of the diabetes and are observed in all glomeruli to the same extent (=diffuse type). Later on, nodular deposits of glycoproteins are additionally found in the mesangium (=nodular type). Only these nodules are morphologically specific for the diabetic disorder. In association with both the diffuse and the nodular glomerulosclerosis, insudation of plasma can be seen in the afferent and efferent vessels and the glomerular capillary loops. The mechanism of the increase in the amount of GBM material is not known, since contradictory data have been reported with regards to both the chemical composition and metabolism of the GBM in human and experimental diabetes. Some postulate that the abnormal deposition of GBM mateiral is due to an excessive synthesis (anabolic disorder), others argue that a further decrease in the normally slow breakdown and disposal (catabolic disorder) might be responsible. This review presents the different pathogenetic concepts of the glomerulosclerosis and attemps to explain the possible causes for the current discrepancies.
