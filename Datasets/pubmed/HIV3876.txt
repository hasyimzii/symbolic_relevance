Two bases are deleted from the termini of HIV 1 linear DNA during integrative recombination.
Proviral integration is a required step in the retrovirus life cycle. The mechanism of integration involves specific modification of the ends of linear viral DNA and subsequent recombination with host sequences. Integration results in the limited loss of sequence information at the termini of the viral genome. The composition of the intact linear DNA termini were inferred by sequencing the 2 long terminal repeat (2 LTR) circle junction that is formed when the linear molecule undergoes intramolecular, blunt end ligation. The junction sequence contained the nucleotides GTAC that were not present at the ends of the integrated provirus. Comparison with the sequence of the LAV 1 strain of HIV 1 demonstrated that the GT dinucleotide derived from the right hand terminus (U5) of the linear viral DNA and the AC dinucleotide came from the left hand terminus (U3). Therefore, the corrected size of the LAV 1 LTR is 637 bp. This conclusion was confirmed independently by assessing the structure of linear viral DNA in acutely infected T cells. A portion of the population of linear HIV 1 DNA molecules were specifically deleted at their 3' ends; the extent of this deletion was 2 bases. This result is consistent with the activity of viral integrase protein on linear viral DNA and it accounts for the structure of integrated HIV 1 proviruses.
