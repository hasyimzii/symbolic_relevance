Detection of antibodies to HTLV I and  III in sera from Japanese hemophiliacs.
Sera from 50 Japanese hemophiliacs were screened for antibodies to human T lymphotropic retrovirus types I and III (HTLV I and  III). As a whole, antibody to HTLV I, antibody to HTLV III, and antibodies to HTLV I and  III were detected in sera from 2, 17, and 6 hemophiliacs, respectively. Among them, two hemophiliacs developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who were positive for both antibodies to HTLV I and  III in sera. All of the others were asymptomatic. Most of the blood products transfused into these hemophiliacs were imported from abroad, whence the source of HTLV III infection presumably originated. However, since quite a high percentage of these antibody positive hemophiliacs was positive for antibody to HTLV I, even though they are native residents in HTLV I nonendemic areas of Japan, some special factors may have participated in HTLV I infection. These special factors should be investigated in the future.
