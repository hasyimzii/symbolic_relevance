Glucose metabolism following endotoxin administration in diabetic rats.
The altered glucose metabolism characteristic of endotoxin induced shock was studied in diabetic and non diabetic rats. Endotoxin administration led to an exaggerated hyperglycemia in the diabetic rats. The exaggerated hyperglycemia appeared to be a consequence of an increased hepatic output of glucose, presumably via gluconeogenesis, as evidenced by an exaggerated glucose turnover following endotoxin. Diabetic and non diabetic rats responded to endotoxin similarly with respect to blood pressure, heart rate, hematocrit, blood pH and plasma lactate. Endotoxin administration did not affect urine flow rate or urinary glucose excretion in either diabetic or non diabetic rats.
