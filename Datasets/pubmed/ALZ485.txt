Correlations between EEG and CT in 79 cases of dementia.
An EEG and CT study was carried out on 79 patients affected by dementia (24 SDAT  and 55 MID). The EEG and CT patterns were compared with those of an age matched control group. Statistical analysis of the CT findings between the demented and normal subjects showed significant differences only for severe atrophy. As far as EEG findings are concerned, no EEG pattern indicative of a specific type of dementia was observed even though a greater number of abnormal EEGs occurred in demented patients than in the control group. Finally, a poor EEG CT correlation was found in demented patients.
