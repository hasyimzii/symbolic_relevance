Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and autoimmune disease in a family.
We diagnosed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia in a father and three offspring. Clinical and subclinical autoimmune disorders occurred excessively in the family. The HLA haplotype A2, B8, DRw3 was detected in all patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and all but one family member with autoimmune manifestations. A lod score [log odds] of 4.86 favors linkage to the HLA complex of a gene predisposing to lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders. Associated with this HLA haplotype were the B cell alloantigens Ia 172 and 350, previously reported in patients with the lymphoma prone sicca syndrome.
