Prevalence of antibodies to HTLV III in AIDS risk groups in West Germany.
The prevalence of antibodies to human T lymphotropic virus III was determined in  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) risk groups by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and confirmatory tests in four different areas in West Germany. Twenty four of 28 homosexual AIDS patients (86%), 24 of 33 homosexual patients with lymphadenopathy syndrome or AIDS related complex (73%), and 44 of 113 asymptomatic homosexuals at risk for AIDS (39%) were seropositive. In three groups of hemophiliacs, 8 of 35 in 1983 (23%), 25 of 65 in early 1984 (39%), and 19 of 23 in late 1984 (83%) showed positive results. Two sera from 36 polytransfused patients were also positive, whereas 36 selected blood donors, and 32 healthy laboratory and clinical personnel were all negative. Also no human T lymphotropic virus III antibodies were detected in sera of 187 prostitutes in the Munich area.
