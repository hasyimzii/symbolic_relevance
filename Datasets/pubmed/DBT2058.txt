Oscillatory potential and nyctometry in insulin dependent diabetics.
The study draws a comparison between the oscillatory potential of the electroretinogram and the initial dark adaptation measured by nyctometry, with the aim of assessing the predictive value of nyctometry in juvenile diabetics. The study included 61 insulin dependent juvenile diabetics, aged 18 49 years, with a disease duration of more than five years. A statistically highly significant correlation could be demonstrated between alterations in the oscillatory potential and in the initial dark adaptation. The results justify the assumption that nyctometry can be used as an easily handled clinical tool in selecting those at risk of developing proliferative retinopathy in their subsequent 6 8 years.
