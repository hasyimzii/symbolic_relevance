Autoradiographic distribution of nicotine receptors in rat brain.
The autoradiographic visualisation of 90% specific tritiated nicotine binding to  slide mounted sections of rat brain is reported. Tritiated nicotine bound with high affinity (nanomolar Kd) and was selectively displaced by nicotinic agonists (e.g. L nicotine approximately ACh greater than D nicotine). The strikingly discrete distribution pattern obtained deviates from that of alpha bungarotoxin, and suggests several possible roles for nicotinic transmission in the brain.
