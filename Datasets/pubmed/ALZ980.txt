Cerebral amyloid angiopathy in dementia and old age.
A necropsy study of 159 elderly patients drawn mainly from a prospectively assessed geriatric hospital population was carried out to investigate the relationship of cerebral amyloid angiopathy to Alzheimer's disease, other CNS disease and ageing. About half the patients were demented and the majority of these had Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease there was an incidence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy of 82%. Among the other groups of patients, both demented and non demented, the incidence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy was a little over 30%, and remained constant between 60 and 102 years of age.
