Therapeutic evaluation of ketoconazole in patients with coccidioidomycosis.
Eleven adult patients (seven men and four nonpregnant women) with coccidioidomycosis were treated orally with ketoconazole (R41,400). Two patients presented with disseminated coccidioidomycosis, six with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, and three with the chronic cutaneous form of the disease. Diagnosis was established by culture of Coccidioides immitis and/or histopathologic identification of the fungus. All patients received 400 mg of ketoconazole per day for the first 10 days; afterwards four of them received 200 mg per day. Evaluation indicated that nine patients improved, one did not, and one could not be assessed. Treatment of coccidioidomycosis with ketoconazole appears to be reasonably effective and produces fewer adverse effects than does amphotericin B; however, further studies of the efficacy of this new drug are needed.
