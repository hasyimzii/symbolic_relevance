Complement dependent cytotoxicity of antibodies reactive with HIV induced cell surface antigens in HIV carrying haemophiliacs.
Sera obtained from HIV infected as well as uninfected haemophiliacs and from healthy subjects were investigated for the presence of lymphocytotoxic antibodies. Using the 51Cr release test, HIV infected haemophiliacs were found to produce serum antibodies exerting complement dependent cytotoxic effect on HIV infected T4 cells. The antibodies were reactive mainly when HIV infected target cells were stimulated with concanavalin A. Results of complement dependent antibody cytotoxicity and indirect membrane immunofluorescence tests suggest that envelope antigen(s) of HIV may be the target(s) for cytotoxic antibodies.
