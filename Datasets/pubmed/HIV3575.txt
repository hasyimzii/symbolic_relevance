Effect of 3' azido 3' deoxythymidine on replication of duck hepatitis B virus in  vivo and in vitro.
3' Azido 3' deoxythymidine (AZT) inhibits the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by blocking the formation of the phosphodiester bond and has been used clinically for the treatment of HIV infection. To assess the effect of AZT on the replication of hepadnaviruses, which replicate through reverse transcription, both the liver tissue and primary cultured hepatocytes from ducklings previously infected with duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) were examined for DHBV DNA before and after the treatment with AZT. We did not observe suppression of DHBV replication at any doses in our system as measured by viral DNA synthesis in infected duck hepatocytes. The data strongly suggest that AZT has no inhibitory effect on DHBV reverse transcriptase.
