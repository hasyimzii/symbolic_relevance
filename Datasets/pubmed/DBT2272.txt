Urinary tract infection in postmenopausal diabetic women. Clinical survey of hospital and nonhospital populations (author's transl).
The incidence and clinical course of urinary tract infections in postmenopausal diabetic patients in comparison to non diabetic women have been evaluated. All cases with former history of urinary instrumentation or underlying conditions favoring urinary infections were rejected. Urinary tract infection was present in 14.9 percent of postmenopausal diabetics versus 10.5 percent in the non diabetics. The incidence of urinary tract infection in premenopausal women was 12.5 percent. Urinary pathogenes showed similar incidence rate in both groups: E. coli (41 versus 57 percent), P. mirabilis (20 versus 28 percent) and Klebsiella (11 versus 20 percent). Diabetic women showed a higher rate of sepsis and infection recurrence than non diabetic (10.7 and 17.8 percent versus 2.6 and 2.6 percent, respectively). Severe impairment of renal function (plasma creatinine clearance > 2 mg/100 ml) was registered in 12.5 percent of postmenopausal patients with diabetes mellitus, but none of the non diabetics suffered renal damage (p < 0.01).
