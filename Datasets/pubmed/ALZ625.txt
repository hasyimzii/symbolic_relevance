Effect of naltrexone on senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
Some reports have suggested that naloxone, a short acting opiate receptor blocker given intravenously, has a beneficial effect on the symptoms of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. We have performed a double blind, crossover trial of naltrexone, an orally active, long acting opiate antagonist, in 17 Alzheimer type dementia patients. None showed any improvement in assessments of day to day living skills or on a battery of neuropsychological tests. No side effects were noted. In the dosage used, naltrexone appears not to be useful in Alzheimer type dementia.
