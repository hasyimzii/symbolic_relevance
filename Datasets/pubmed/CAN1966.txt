Effect of propranolol on glucose induced insulin response in rats with insulinomas.
This paper describes an inhibitory effect of propranolol on insulin secretion in  rats with pancreatic islet cell tumors which have been induced by streptozotocin (65 mg/kg body weight) and nicotinamide (500 mg/kg). Following glucose ingestion (3 g/kg), propranolol (4 mg/kg) was injected into the tumor bearing rats. Plasma insulin decreased paradoxically despite an increase in blood glucoses. In contrast, propranolol did not suppress insulin secretion in normal rats. The drug was found to have no effect on glucagon secretion in either experimental or control animals during glucose load. This may suggest that the experimentally induced insulinoma in hypersensitive to propranolol for inhibiting insulin secretion.
