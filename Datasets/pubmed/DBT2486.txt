Ischaemia and neovascularization.
Varied clinical situations associated with ocular neovascularization are described and categorized according to whether they are initially venous, capillary, or arterial obstructive in origin. Common to many of these entities is the presence of retinal ischaemia, as evidenced by retinal capillary non perfusion with intravenous fluorescein angiography. The similarities between an experimental angiogenesis model and clinical vasoproliferative disease states are also noted.
