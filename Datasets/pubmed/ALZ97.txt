Immunocytochemical studies of neurofibrillary tangles.
The molecular nature of neurofibrillary tangles of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was studied by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence techniques. Five antiserums, including anti humanbrain 2 cycle purified microtubule fractions (2 x MT), anti calf brain 2 x MT, anti sea urchin egg tubulin, antibeef brain tubulin, and anti human brain neurofilament(NF) 210 kilodalton(kd) protein were tested for their binding to neurofibrillary tangles. The antihuman 2 x MT serum stained structures resembling neurofibrillary tangles, neurites of neuritic plaques, and microglialike cells in SDAT brains, but no such staining pattern was detected in normal brain sections. In neurons isolated from SDAT brains, about 40% of the tangles were labeled by the anti human 2xMT serum with an identical pattern. Other antiserums tested did not preferentially bind tanglelike structures in tissue sections and bound to less than 5% of the tangles in isolated neurons. These results suggest that the antigenic sites of tubulin and NF proteins are not shared by neurofibrillary tangles. Different from the calf preparation, the human 2 x MT fractions contained a prominent protein band that was identical to ferritin in molecular weight and cross reacted with anti human 2 x MT and anti human ferritin serums. However, antiserums to this ferritinlike protein, or anti ferritin, did not stain neurofibrillary tangles. Although neither the calf 2 x MT nor two other human MT fractions failed to elicit an antiserum that stained tangles, these fractions were able to remove the antihuman 2 x MT serum activity that binds to tangles. The data suggest that the protein (or proteins) that makes up neurofibrillary tangles of SDAT is present in various quantities in microtubule fractions of normal brain.
