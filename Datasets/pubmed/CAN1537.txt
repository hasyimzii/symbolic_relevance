Changes in the glycogen phosphorylase isozyme pattern of AH130 during cell growth.
Changes in the glycogen phosphorylase isozyme patterns of AH130 and AH66F during  cell growth were investigated immunochemically and electrophoretically. The content of the liver like type increased as the cell growth in the ascites decreased, while the level of the fetal type (or prototype) remained approximately constant. The isozyme shift from the fetal type to liver like type was more marked in subcutaneous solid AH130. In AH130 cells cultured in vitro under growth inhibited conditions, the content of the hybrid between the above two types was increased, with increased amount of liver like subunit. These results indicate that the phosphorylase isozyme patterns of Yoshida ascites hepatomas vary during cell growth under different conditions.
