Indomethacin mediated enhancement of lymphocyte response to mitogens in healthy subjects and lung cancer patients.
Indomethacin (prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor) was found to be capable of enhancing the mitogen induced lymphocyte proliferative responses of healthy subjects and patients with lung cancer. A whole blood culture technique was used. Indomethacin had no mitogenic activity. We observed a greater enhancement of lymphocyte response by indomethacin in weak responders as compared with strong responders in healthy subjects and lung cancer patients. A greater enhancement was also noted in lung cancer patients with active disease as compared with lung cancer patients in remission. In a separated cell culture system, the indomethacin exerted no effect on purified T cells in the absence of monocytes, while this agent exerted its enhancement effect on T lymphocyte response in the presence of autologous monocytes of lung cancer patients. This suggests that monocytes (suppressor cells) may secrete prostaglandins, which are responsible for the impairment of T lymphocyte response in lung cancer patients.
