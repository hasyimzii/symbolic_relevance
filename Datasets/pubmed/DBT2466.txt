The role of biomaterials in insulin delivery systems.
The control of blood glucose levels in diabetes involving devices are critically  reviewed, and the role of blood contacting biomaterial components analyzed. These include mechanical insulin delivery systems of the closed loop type that require an electronic glucose sensor and feedback, and open loop systems that deliver insulin without a sensor and feedback. Whole pancreatic and islet transplantations, islet encapsulation, and the potential role of polymeric sustained drug delivery systems are discussed. The medical and social impacts of diabetes mellitus are of prime public health concern and of even greater magnitude than those of heart disease in the United States. While future advances in device design, miniaturization, and biomaterials technology will significantly add to the arsenal of therapeutic alternatives, devices capable of controlling blood glucose levels ought to be viewed as mere interim phases rather than as final goals of the problem.
