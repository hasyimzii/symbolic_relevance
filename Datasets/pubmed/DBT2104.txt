Increased somatostatin secretion from pancreatic islets of streptozotocin diabetic rats in response to glucose.
Glucose stimulates somatostatin release from perifused pancreatic islets of diabetic rats 42 47 days after the induction of diabetes, and 48 h after withdrawal of insulin replacement therapy. The glucose effect is augmented by theophylline or glucagon. Basal somatostatin release and glucose induced secretion are significantly higher in diabetic islets than in controls. It is suggested that glucose promotes somatostatin release by directly interacting with islet D cells but not via indirect pathways. Glucose induced stimulation appears to be modulated by a D cell adenylate cyclase/phosphodiesterase system. Reasons responsible for increased somatostatin secretion by diabetic islets include reduction in B cell mass, suggesting that B cells may normally suppress the secretory activity of D cells.
