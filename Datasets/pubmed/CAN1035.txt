Urinary excretion of beta 2 microglobulin in myeloma patients.
The levels of beta 2 microglobulin in urine and serum were determined in 39 patients with myelomatosis. In 25 patients the serum beta 2 microglobulin was elevated, and in seven of the patients with increased serum beta microglobulin the urinary excretion of the protein was also increased. It was concluded that the increased urine beta microglobulin indicates a renal tubular disorder.
