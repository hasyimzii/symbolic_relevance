Immunological indices in presenile Alzheimer's disease.
Immunological indices, both T  and B dependent, were studied in 11 patients affected by presenile Alzheimer's disease. The data obtained were compared with those from a group of normal adults of similar age and from a group of normal young subjects. Furthermore, antisera were produced in rabbits against Alzheimer's serum and compared to antisera against normal human serum. The following results were obtained: decrease of serum IgM levels; no monoclonal aspects or auto antibodies were detected in our patients. The kappa/lambda ratio was also normal. The T cell system was functionally normaly, but with a slight decrease of the T cell number and with an increase of the Null lymphocytes. No specific serum proteins were found in the anti Alzheimer antisera. The data are discussed in correlation to the possible genesis of senile plaques.
