Is DH ergotoxine the best gerontologicum from the ergot source? Experimental comparison with individual components.
The effect of DH ET (dihydroergotoxine = 33% DH ergocornine (DH ECO) + 33% DH ergocristine (DH ECS) + + 33% DH ergokryptine (DH alfa ECP: DH beta ECP = 2:1 and that of the single DH derivatives on the retention of 14C uridine (14C U) in three parts of the brain tissue, blood plasma and liver tissue was estimated (i.e. radioactivity four hours after ip. adm. of 74kBq X 100 g 1). In young male rats DH ET and DH ECO enhanced the retention of 14C U especially in the parietal cortex In one year old males DH ECS and DH alfa ECP had the greatest effect. As a model of undesired effects the influence on peripheral blood flow in the hind limb of urethanised rats was examined using the perfusion' technics. All substances in the dose of 1 microgram removed epinephrine induced vasoconstriction although they themselves in the dose of 100 micrograms enhanced the perfusion pressure, excepting DH ECO. All substances diminished the liver blood pool in urethanised rabbits (as norepinephrine does), most efficient being DH beta ECP and DH ECO. On the other hand these substances also slowed the velocity of blood stream. The highest toxicity (LD) of DH ECS and the lowest one of DH alfa ECP was found by an infusion technique. All substances diminished heart frequency but had a variable effect on PQ and QT ECG intervals. Ranging all substances according to their desirable properties from the geriatric viewpoint an index for each substance was calculated. This was most advantageous in the case of DH alfa ECP and DH ECS in contrast to DH ET and DH ECO.
