The effect of streptozotocin induced diabetes in rats on cardiac contractile proteins.
In order to determine whether diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats is associated with  altered contractile proteins, male and female rats were made diabetic with intravenous streptozotocin (STZ). Calcium ATPase activity of cardiac actomyosin was significantly decreased after 1 week of diabetes and was depressed by 60% by 2 weeks. Rats pretreated with 3 O methyl glucose to prevent the hyperglycemia caused by STZ had normal Ca2+ actomyosin ATPase activities, and non diabetic rats whose food was restricted to keep their body and heart weights similar to those found in diabetic animals had only a slight fall in actomyosin ATPase activity. Ca2+ ATPase and actin activated ATPase activities of pure myosin were similarly depressed in preparations from hearts of diabetic animals. Sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing failed to reveal differences in the patterns of contractile proteins or light subunits between diabetics and controls, but pyrophosphate gels showed a shift in the myosin pattern. Because of depressed circulating thyroid hormone levels in diabetic animals, cardiac contractile proteins were also studied in preparations from thyroidectomized rats. Calcium activities of actomyosin and myosin ATPase were lower than values found in hearts of diabetic rats. When diabetic animals were kept euthyroid with thyroid replacement, actomyosin ATPase activity was still depressed. Thus STZ diabetes causes a significant decrease in cardiac contractile protein ATPase activity. This may be related to altered proportions of myosin isoenzymes.
