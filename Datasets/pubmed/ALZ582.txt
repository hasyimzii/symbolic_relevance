Alzheimer's disease with widespread presence of Lewy bodies.
Progressive mental deterioration associated with parkinsonism was observed in a 68 year old patient in the senile period. Pathologically, evidence of senile changes was obtained consisting of degeneration of the neurons and numerous senile plaques with classical and perivascular types. Further, neuronal degeneration in the form of Lewy bodies was evidently observed in the hypothalamus, substantia nigra et innominata, locus caeruleus of the vagus nerve, some nuclei in the reticular formation of the brainstem and neurons in the cerebral cortex. The clinical and pathological manifestations were those of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. It is suggested that some common etiological factors may cause those lesions as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
