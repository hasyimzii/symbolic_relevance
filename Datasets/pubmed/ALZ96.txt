Double blind trial of 2 dimethylaminoethanol in Alzheimer's disease.
A double blind, placebo controlled trial of 2 dimethylaminoethanol was undertaken in 27 patients with moderately severe or severe Alzheimer's disease. Of 13 patients in the drug group, 6 were withdrawn in the first 5 weeks of the trial because of side effects, which included drowsiness and retardation, with an increase of confusion and mild elevation of blood pressure. No significant benefit appeared from the drug treatment.
