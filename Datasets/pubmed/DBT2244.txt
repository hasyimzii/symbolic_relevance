Adipose, muscle and lung tissue lipoprotein lipase activities in young streptozotocin treated rats.
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was studied in adipose, muscle and lung tissues of post weanling rats 48 and 96 hours after experimentally induced diabetes by streptozotocin administration. Weight gain was reduced, and blood glucose level increased about 3 4 fold above the control level as an indication of the diabetic state. LPL activity in brown and white adipose tissues decreased in diabetic rats to 10 30% of the control level. In soleus muscle the LPL activity was slightly enhanced 96 hours after the streptozotocin injection. In cardiac muscle the LPL activity was markedly increased already 48 hours after the administration of streptozotocin and the increase remained significant until 96 hours. There was in the pulmonary tissue also an increase of LPL activity of diabetic rats, although this was significant only 96 hours after streptozotocin treatment. The results suggest marked tissue specific variation in the LPL activity. Moreover, tissue responses to experimentally induced diabetes vary. In adipose tissue the decrease in the LPL activity suggests that lipid transport to adipocytes is decreased while an increase in skeletal and cardiac muscles and in lung tissue proposes that their lipid utilization is enhanced.
