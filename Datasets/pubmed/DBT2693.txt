Induction of renin release by exogenous prostaglandins in hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism.
A deficiency in renal prostaglandin synthesis has been proposed as the cause of the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. To determine if renin release could be stimulated by pharmacologic infusions of PGA1, we infused PGA1 0.075 to 0.60 microgram/kg/min to nine patients with the syndrome. Total renal PGE production as measured by urinary PGE excretion was normal (650 +/  169 vs 400 +/  55 ng/24hr in normal subjects). Renin (PRA) was markedly depressed in all patients despite stimulation with upright posture and furosemide (1.0 +/  0.4 vs 9.3 +/  0.7 ng/ml/hr, p < 0.001). But in two patients PGA1, induced an increase in renin similar to that of normal subjects. PRA increased to a lesser degree in two other patients and plasma aldosterone slightly increased. Five showed no response. Infusions of nitroprusside in doses and duration that mimicked the hypotensive effects of PGA1 failed to increase PRA or aldosterone. The data suggest that total renal PGE production is normal in patients with the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. Although orthostasis, furosemide and nitroprusside do not increase renin, prostaglandin A1 infusion appears to be a potent stimulus to renin release in some of the patients.
