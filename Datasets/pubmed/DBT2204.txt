Diabetic renal transplantation.
Fifty three juvenile onset diabetics have received 59 renal allografts: 31 from living related donors and 27 from cadaveric donors. The average patient age was 34 years and the duration of diabetes was 27 years at the time of transplantation. Patient survival rates for living related recipients at 1 and 2 years were 97 and 94 per cent, respectively. Patient survival rates for cadaveric recipients at 1 and 2 years were 85 and 66 per cent, respectively. Renal allograft survival rates for living related recipients were 81 per cent at 1 year and 71 per cent at 2 years. Cadaveric renal allograft survival rates were 22 per cent at 1 year and 20 per cent at 2 years. The role of pre transplant coronary angiography relative to patient selection and a recent decrease in our perioperative mortality are discussed.
