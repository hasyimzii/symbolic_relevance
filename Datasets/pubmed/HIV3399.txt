An improved method for the detection of HIV antigen in the blood of carriers.
The measurement of HIV antigen levels in sera or plasma of HIV infected individuals is critical for determining the existence of antigen or infectious virus before seroconversion and for prognosis. Pretreatment of sera or plasma of HIV carriers by heating at 70 degrees C for 10 min at an acidic pH enabled us to estimate antigens efficiently in immune complexes. This procedure will also be useful in determining antigen levels in HIV carriers more precisely.
