Central amine metabolism in Alzheimer's disease: in vivo relationship to cognitive deficit.
Levels of the amine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were measured in the cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid of drug free patients with Alzheimer's disease and compared to levels in a group of controls. No significant differences were found in CSF HVA and MHPG, although the Alzheimer's group was severely demented. Platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme kinetics were measured and did not differ between controls and Alzheimer patients. The degree of dementia did not show any significant correlation with the levels of HVA or MHPG. It was concluded that, unlike previous reports in the literature, the dementia of Alzheimer's disease was not related to changes in central catecholamine metabolism nor was it associated with increased platelet MAO activity.
