The clinical significance of HbA1c determination in diabetics.
It is reported on HbA1c as a suitable screening method for the estimation of a long range situation of metabolism in diabetics. The relations of HbA1c concentration to the level of blood glucose and to the secretion quantity of urine glucose are represented. The highest HbA1c concentrations found out do not correlate with the level of the single concentration of blood glucose which as a rapid method are not representative for the whole position of glycaemia. Further investigations concerning the estimation of the temporal interval of the change of the HbA1c concentration in dependence on blood glucose and urinary glucose concentration must be carried out.
