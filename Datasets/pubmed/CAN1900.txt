Genetic control of sensitivity to Moloney leukemia virus in mice. III. The three  H 2 linked Rmv genes are immune response genes controlling the antiviral antibody response.
It has been shown previously that three different H 2 associated genes control the resistance to viremia and leukemia in Moloney virus infected mice: Rmv. 1, mapping to the I A or less probably K regions; Rmv. 2, mapping to the I C, S or G regions and Rmv. 3, mapping to the D or T regions. Experiments have been performed to determine the role of these genes in the control of the antibody responses directed against Moloney murine leukemia virus (M. MuLV) virions and/or leukemic cells. The inoculation of infectious M.MuLV failed to provide conclusive responses due to unequal replication of the virus in different inbred strains resulting in variable antigenic stimulations and/or in vivo antibody absorptions. The use of inactivated M.MuLV as antigen allowed to avoid these problems. It showed that (2) the IgG specific antiM.MuLV response is controlled by H 2 linked genes, (b) a clear correlation exists between high or low responder phenotypes and the resistance or susceptibility to M.MuLV infection and (c) all three Rmv genes behave like immune response genes. These results were not surprising for Rmv. 1 and Rmv. 2 which map in the I region of the major histocompatibility complex. It was more puzzling for Rmv. 3. Further experiments are necessary to determine the exact mechanism by which this gene controls the immune response.
