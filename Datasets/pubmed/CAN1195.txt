A comparative study of serum alpha 1 microglobulin and beta 2 microglobulin levels in cancerous and other diseases.
The levels of serum alpha 1 microglobulin in 60 normal persons and in 191 patients suffering from a variety of benign and malignant disorders were determined by an enzyme immunoassay, and these values were compared with the levels of beta 2 microglobulin. A discrepancy between the serum levels of these proteins was found in hepatobiliary disorders; that is, an increased serum level of beta 2 microglobulin was observed in 73.9%, while in only 4.3% was there an elevation of alpha 1 microglobulin. In particular, alpha 1 microglobulin levels in patients with liver cirrhosis were well below the normal range, while beta 2 microglobulin levels were elevated. Elevated levels of both proteins were noted in patients with some impairments of renal function, particularly in chronic renal failure, and in immunological diseases. In 81 patients with neoplastic diseases, a high alpha 1 microglobulin value was found in only 15 patients (16.4%), while a high beta 2 microglobulin value in 62 patients (76.5%). The serum levels of both alpha 1 microglobulin and beta 2 microglobulin were especially high in plasma cell dyscrasia with Bence Jones protein, but other neoplastic diseases were mostly associated with beta 2 microglobulin elevation alone.
