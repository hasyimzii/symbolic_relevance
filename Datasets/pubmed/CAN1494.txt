Chemotherapy of advanced prostatic cancer with adriamycin, BCNU, and cyclophosphamide.
A phase II trial of Adriamycin, BCNU, and cyclophosphamide was performed in 29 patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma (Southeastern Cancer Study Group protocol SEG 76 PR 0102P). Therapy consisted of BCNU 100 mg/m2, plus cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2 i.v., on day 1, followed by Adriamycin, 30 mg/m2 i.v., on day 2. Therapy was repeated every four weeks. In 27 evaluable patients refractory to prior estrogen therapy, one patient had a complete response, six patients had partial responses, and two patients had objective improvement (complete plus partial response rate 26%, and overall response rate 33%). Responders had a median time to progression of disease of 5.5 months, compared with a median time to progression of 4.0 months for those patients with stable disease. The median survival of responders was 9.3 months, compared with 6.7 months for stable disease and 3.9 months for patients with progression. Patients with higher pretreatment performance status did not have higher response rates. No life threatening toxicity was observed. Only five patients had nadir platelet counts below 50,000/mm3, and only six patients had nadir granulocyte counts below 750/mm3. This regimen palliates the effects of hormone resistant metastatic prostatic carcinoma.
