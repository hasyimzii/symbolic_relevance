Ventricular size in patients with presenile dementia of the Alzheimer's type.
The computed tomograms (CTs) of eight mild to moderately impaired patients with presenile dementia of Alzheimer's type (aged 53 to 64 years) were compared with scans of ten healthy age matched controls. Two computer programs and a variety of linear measurements were used to analyze the CTs. A single computerized measure of fluid volume on the slice at the maximum width of the bodies of the lateral ventricles correctly predicts the group membership of 88.89% of the subjects. Computerized measures on other CT slices do not increase discrimination between the groups. Easily performed linear measures correctly predict the group membership of 78.9% of the subjects. Computerized measures of ventricular size may provide highly valuable information for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in the presenile age range.
