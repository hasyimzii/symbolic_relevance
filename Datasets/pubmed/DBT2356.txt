Managing the patient with peripheral neuropathy.
Peripheral neuropathy may be a minor, even unrecognized, clinical problem, or it  may be severe and virtually disabling. As in any chronic disorder, the physician's role is to look for treatable disease and to teach patients about the symptoms and natural history of the dysfunction as well as methods for coping with it. The physician can help patients by explaining how to contend with a damaged peripheral nervous system on a daily basis, even if healing or significant organic relief cannot be achieved.
