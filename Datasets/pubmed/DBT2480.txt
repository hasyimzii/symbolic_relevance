Improvement of diabetic symptoms of hereditary diabetic (KK) mice by a single injection with islet activating protein (IAP).
Islet activating protein (IAP) prepared from the culture medium of Bordetella pertussis cells was very effective in eliminating diabetic symptoms characteristic of hereditary diabetic KK mice over a long period of time. After a single injection of IAP (5 microgram/kg body wt) into KK mice, the non fasting concentration of blood glucose was maintained nearly normal over 2 weeks, with a gradual return to the pre IAP level 30 days later. During this period, glucose tolerance was normalized and only few animals excreted glucose in urine. The second injection of IAP to these diabetic mice caused a more prolonged restoration of normoglycemia. When KK mice had been injected with IAP, they responded to epinephrine and isoproterenol more readily than did ddY mice in increasing plasma insulin and glycerol.
