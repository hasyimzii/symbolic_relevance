Evidence for HTLV III/LAV expression by primary cultures of T8 cells.
The selective targets for HTLV III/LAV, the causal infectious agent of AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC), are T4 cells, apparently because the virus receptor is associated with T4 antigen determinants. This accounts for T4 cell depletion in AIDS and for a decrease of IL 2 production by AIDS peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) after in vitro PHA activation. By contrast, T8 cells are not targets for HTLV III/LAV, since T8 cells from PBL and from long term cultured T cells (CTC) could not be infected by the virus. We describe 2 samples of PBL from Zairian patients with HTLV III infection in which HTLV III was expressed by T8 cells. Evidence that T8 cells were expressing virus was obtained by complement cytotoxicity experiments performed in the presence of OKT8 monoclonal antibody (MAb), which removed HTLV III positive cells from cultured T cells producing the virus, and by double labelling experiments, in which some cells exhibit both T8 antigens detected either by IFA (rhodamine) or by rosetting in presence of OKT8 MAbs and HTLV III antigens detected by IFA (fluorescein) with of anti HTLV III p24 and p15 MAbs. Since normal T cells have previously been shown to undergo antigenic diversity, we think these results can be explained by HTLV III infection of T4 cells which later lost T4 antigens and acquired the T8 phenotype.
