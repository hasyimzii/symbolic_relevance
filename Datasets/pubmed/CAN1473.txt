Modification of early dimethylhydrazine carcinogenesis by colonic mucosal hyperplasia.
The interaction of colonic mucosal hyperplasia with early 1,2 dimethylhydrazine (DMH) carcinogenesis was studied in random bred NIH Swiss mice utilizing hyperplasia inducing Citrobacter freundii. Mice inoculated with this bacterium developed significantly more DMH focal atypia than did mice without hyperplasia following a single dose of DMH (20 mg/kg). Mice with hyperplasia also developed DMH focal atypia with diminished doses of DMH (10 and 5 mg/kg), while normal mice did not. The effect of C. freundii on early DMH carcinogenesis was shown to be due to the hyperplasia rather than to a direct interaction of the bacterium with DMH. Focal atypia arose in high incidence 1 month after a single dose of DMH (20 mg/kg) but did not appear to progress to later stages of neoplasia, since significantly fewer atypia were present at 2 to 4 months among a randomized population. Colonic focal atypia may represent a reversible preneoplastic or precursor lesion as seen in other tissues, with features more aligned to neoplasia than to hyperplasia.
