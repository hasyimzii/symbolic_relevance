Experience with 50 clinical manifestations of small intestine tumors.
During the last 20 years we have seen 50 tumors of the small bowel, of which 28 were malignant. The low 5 year survival rate of 33.8% was due to a high operative mortality because of an advanced stage of the disease with ensuing complications such as perforation. In 50% of all obstructive tumors, associated peptic ulcerative lesions have been observed in the stomach or duodenum probably induced by stasis in the upper bowel. Therefore, the small bowel should always be inspected carefully during operation for peptic ulcer which did not heal with conservative treatment.
