Pituitary response to gonadotropin releasing hormone in diabetic male rats.
The rise in serum lutenizing hormone concentration after treatment with gonadotropin releasing hormone was less in diabetic castrated male rats than control castrates. In intact male rats, gonadotropin releasing hormone treatment resulted in higher serum luteinizing hormone concentrations in diabetic than in control rats.
