HIV serology among Italian male military recruits at entrance and discharge.
To evaluate the usefulness of anti HIV mass screenings, we examined 662 new military recruits and 1353 soldiers being discharged. None of the former and only one of the latter (0.07%) resulted seropositive on repeated ELISA and Western blot. For comparison we also report the results of routine anti HIV antibody testing in our diagnostic laboratory: the highest proportion of seropositive subjects was found among symptomatic patients (79%), followed by haemophiliac patients (31%), drug addicts (24%), sexual partners of seropositive subjects (21%), prisoners (5%) and homosexual men (5%). Health care personnel and prison guards were all negative. These data confirm that in Italy HIV infection is still relatively confined to the classic risk groups. While generalized screening during military service seems to be excessive, periodic sample surveys could be very useful to follow the evolution of HIV epidemiology.
