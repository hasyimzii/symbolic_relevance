Clofibrate induced myopathy in patients with diabetes insipidus.
Clofibrate has been considered to be a relatively safe antidiuretic in the treatment of diabetes insipidus. However, we have recently had four cases of clofibrate induced myopathy in patients with diabetes insipidus due to hypothalamic lesions. Physicians should therefore be aware of its occurrence and carefully monitor serum levels of CPK, GOT and GPT during the treatment of diabetes insipidus with clofibrate, especially in patients with associated hypothyroidism, latent or overt, which possibly favors the development of myopathy.
