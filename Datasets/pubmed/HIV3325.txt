Phosphorothioate and normal oligodeoxyribonucleotides with 5' linked acridine: characterization and preliminary kinetics of cellular uptake.
Certain phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (S oligo) analogs, unlike their normal congeners, have been found to exhibit significant anti HIV activity [Matsukura et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 (1987) 7706 7710]. Here we report melting temperatures (Tm) of a series of S oligos compared with those of the corresponding normal oligomers. The Tm's for AT base pairs of S oligos are significantly depressed relative to normal oligos, while GC containing S oligos show much less Tm depression. The Tm's of S dT oligomers with poly(rA) are reduced relative to the duplexes with normal dA oligomers. These results provide a rational basis for the S d(CG) sequences as anti message inhibitors of gene expression. We also describe an automated synthesis of 5' acridine linked oligothymidylates using phosphoramidite linked acridine. During this synthesis we noted the replacement of thiophenol for the 6 chloro substituent on acridine. We have measured the Tm's of the compounds with 3 and 5 methylene groups linked to normal and phosphorothioate dTn (with n = 3 40) on duplex formation with the equivalent dAn, and have found small increases of Tm for the 5 methylene linked acridine derivative. We have monitored the uptake of these fluorescently labeled oligos into HL60 cells, and found that the shorter oligos are more rapidly taken up than the longer, and the normal oligos faster than the S oligos. The temperature dependence of the cellular uptake suggests an energy dependent process, and a possible membrane receptor for oligos. These results have significance for the potential use of such compounds as inhibitors of gene expression.
