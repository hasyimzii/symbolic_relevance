Health outcomes of a community based therapy program for children with cancer  a  shared management approach.
Critical to providing cancer therapy to children in rural areas is finding dependable sources of therapy near the patients' homes. In this study, comparison was made of 668 visits by 24 patients to nearby private practitioners, who carried out 70% of the therapy, with 712 visits by 22 other patients for whom all care was managed by pediatric hematologist oncologists. There was no significant difference by Wilcoxon rank sum test between the two groups in the accuracy with which protocol rules were followed, in the incidence of neutropenia, infection, fever, thrombocytopenia, drug toxicity, or the proportion of days hospitalized. The findings indicate that the private practitioners participating in a shared management system were a dependable resource for providing 70% of the total cancer therapy to these patients.
