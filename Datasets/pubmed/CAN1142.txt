Listeria monocytogenes action on viral T8 epithelioma growth.
Effects of Listeria monocytogenes on normal and tumor bearing rats were evaluated. Inhibition of T8 tumor and its metastases in tumor bearing rats treated with L. monocytogenes was observed. Macrophage phagocyte functions, depressed in tumor bearing rats, was restored by L., monocytogenes. In particular, a dissociation between different macrophages functions in tumor bearing rats was observed.
