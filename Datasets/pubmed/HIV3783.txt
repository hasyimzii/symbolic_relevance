Inhibition of HIV 1 replication by a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.
A series of dipyridodiazepinones have been shown to be potent inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) reverse transcriptase (RT). One compound, BI RG 587, had a Ki of 200 nanomolar for inhibition of HIV 1 RT that was noncompetitive with respect to deoxyguanosine triphosphate. BI RG 587 was specific for HIV 1 RT, having no effect on feline and simian RT or any mammalian DNA polymerases. BI RG 587 inhibited HIV 1 replication in vitro as demonstrated by in situ hybridization, inhibition of protein p24 production, and the lack of syncytia formation in cultured human T cell lines and freshly isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Cytotoxicity studies of BI RG 587 on human cells showed a high therapeutic index (greater than 8000) in culture.
