Glucose stimulation of somatostatin and insulin release from the isolated, perfused rat pancreas.
Insulin and somatostatin release from the isolated perfused rat pancreas was studied under conditions of 50 and 300 mg/dl glucose as well as a linear 50 300 mg/dl glucose gradient. The glucose stimulated response profile of somatostatin was nearly parallel to that of insulin in both the acute and gradient dose experiments. Antisomatostatin serum was without significant effect on glucose stimulated insulin release. In spite of the marked, fifteenfold stimulation of somatostatin release (1.5 x 10 10 M in the perfusate effluent) by glucose, the concentration of somatostatin was insufficient to significantly alter glucose stimulated insulin release in the isolated perfused rat pancreas.
