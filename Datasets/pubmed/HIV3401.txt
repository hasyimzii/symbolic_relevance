The diagnostic value of immunologic findings in the differentiation of chronic liver diseases.
Various types of virus induced and non virus induced chronic active hepatitis (CAH) as well as chronic non suppurative destructive cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis have to be distinguished. Classical autoimmune type "lupoid" CAH is characterized by antinuclear antibodies (ANA), liver membrane antibodies (LMA) and smooth muscle antibodies (SMA). A second subgroup of autoimmune type CAH is characterized by anti liver kidney microsomal antibodies (LKM) which are directed against a specific cytochrome p 450 isoenzyme. A third subgroup of autoimmune type CAH is identified by auto antibodies to a soluble cytoplasmic liver antigen (SLA). Autoimmune type CAH profits from immuno suppressive therapy, i.e. corticosteroids alone or in combination with azathioprin. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is nowadays treated with Interferon when HBV DNA is detectable in serum, duration of liver disease is less than 5 years and superinfection with HDV and HIV can be excluded. PBC is diagnosed through the detection of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and its PBC specific subtypes anti p 62 (M2) and anti p 48. Aetiology and pathogenesis of PBC are still unknown. Liver transplantation is an established therapy for endstage PBC. This is also true for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).
