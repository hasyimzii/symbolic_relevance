Brodie's abscess. A study of 181 cases, with special reference to radiographic diagnostic criteria.
A study of 181 cases of Brodie's abscess, in which the diagnosis was histologically confirmed, was made in order to demonstrate radiographic factors common to other conditions, and therefore likely to pose questions of differential diagnosis. Some of the pathological characteristics of Brodie's abscess are described and correlated with the differing radiographic appearances of this inflammatory bone lesion.
