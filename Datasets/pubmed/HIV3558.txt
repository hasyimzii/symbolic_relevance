Prognostic factors in HIV seropositive children by materno fetal transmission.
Ninety four cases with HIV seropositive children who were found in the Hospital Necker Enfants Malades in France from April 1983 till September 1988 due to materno fetal transmission were surveyed for immunological studies as well as the relationship between clinical symptoms and the prognosis. Lymphoadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly were found in 98% of the total cases. Opportunistic infections, severe neurological problems and LIP were found in 28%, 16% and 15%, respectively. At the first laboratory examination, cases showing under 500/mm3 of OKT4 lymphocytes and with negative antigen induced proliferative responses were observed in 24% and 44% of the cases, respectively. Negative serological profiles of antibodies to P18 and P25 HIV antigens appeared to show low values of OKT4 lymphocytes and abnormal responses to antigens. The survival cases with these findings were minimum. These data indicate that it is very much worth, while to estimate the degree of immunological deficiency and infectious complications.
