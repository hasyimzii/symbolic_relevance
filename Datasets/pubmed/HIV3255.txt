Antiviral activity of phosphonylmethoxyalkyl derivatives of purine and pyrimidines.
Various 3 hydroxy 2 phosphonylmethoxypropyl (HPMP) and 2 phosphonylmethoxyethyl (PME) derivatives of purine [adenine (A), guanine (G), 2,6 diaminopurine (DAP), 2 monoaminopurine (MAP), hypoxanthine (HX)] and pyrimidine [cytosine (C), uracil (U), thymine (T)] have been evaluated for their antiviral properties. PMEDAP, (S) HPMPA [and the cyclic phosphonate thereof, (S) cHPMPA)], (S) HPMPC, PMEG, PMEA, HPMPG and HPMPDAP proved to be effective inhibitors of herpes simplex virus
