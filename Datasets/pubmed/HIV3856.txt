Identification of a low affinity subset of protamine reactive IgM antibodies present in normal, deficient in AIDS, sera: implications for HIV latency.
We demonstrate here that the protamine reactive IgM antibodies previously shown to be present in normal adult sera include two subsets differing in binding affinity. The principal, high affinity subset was detected in AIDS and ARC as well as normal sera. The secondary, low affinity subset, however, was absent or markedly deficient in AIDS or ARC sera. Protamine reactive IgM antibodies were also detected in normal pediatric sera, suggesting that one subset of that class of antibodies may be "natural," i.e., not antigenically induced. The proportionate titer of the low affinity protamine reactive IgM antibodies was determined for HIV positive males who were asymptomatic or mildly immune deficient at specimen collection. Of those who subsequently remained AIDS free for 18 months to 7 years, more than 90% had titers in the range established for the normal sera, while of those diagnosed with AIDS or ARC within 12 months, more than 80% had titers below the normal range. We propose that the low affinity subset of adult sera corresponds to the natural antibodies of pediatric sera and that a relationship of those natural antibodies to resistance to progression of HIV pathogenesis is suggested.
