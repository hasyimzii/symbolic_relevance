Psoriasis and HIV infection.
This study concerns 15 together H.I.V. positive and psoriatic patients. The existing relationship between psoriasis and H.I.V. infection associated in the same patient still remains quite unclear. However, some conclusions may be drawn from those studies devoted to the association psoriasis H.I.V. infection. Psoriasis may be the first clinical manifestation and should draw attention on behalf of its possibly clinically atypical pattern, of its evolution and of its frequent unresponsiveness to treatment. It may lead to the discovery of an H.I.V. seropositivity. Immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate, phototherapy...) should be avoided in such patients unless under specific circumstances.
