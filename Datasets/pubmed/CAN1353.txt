Sotos syndrome with intestinal polyposis and pigmentary changes of the genitalia.
We report two adult males with the Sotos syndrome, who also presented intestinal  polyposis and pigmentary spotting of the shaft and glans penis. We propose that patients with the Sotos syndrome may develop hamartoneoplastic disease and we urge clinicians to consider this possibility in those patients.
