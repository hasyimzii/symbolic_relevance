Processes of verbal memory failure in Alzheimer type dementia.
Multiple aspects of verbal learning and memory performance in mild as compared to moderate Alzheimer type dementia (ATD) were studied with the Buschke selective reminding paradigm. Results show that (1) both groups of ATD subjects depend less on long term memory (LTM) and more on short term memory (STM) relative to elderly control subjects, (2) mild ATD subjects show less LTM encoding than moderate ATD subjects, (3) moderate ATD subjects retrieve a smaller portion of the items presumed to be encoded into LTM than do mild ATD subjects, and (4) high imagery words increase LTM encoding and retrieval as compared to low imagery words for moderate ATD subjects only. These results are explained by the inability of ATD subjects to attend to more than one component of the list learning task, in conjunction with differences in the deployment of attention between mild and moderate ATD subjects.
