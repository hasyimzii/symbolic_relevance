In vitro carcinogenesis of hepatocytes obtained from acetylaminofluorene treated  rat liver and promotion of their growth by phenobarbital.
The hepatic cells of rats being fed acetylaminofluorene were transferred into culture at various times. Proliferative hepatocytic foci were obtained from animals treated with the carcinogen for more than 9 weeks. These hepatocytic foci became transplantable and capable of growth in soft agar after 4 to 12 months in culture. Phenobarbital markedly enhanced the growth of these hepatocytes in culture.
