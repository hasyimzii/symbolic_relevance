Anti human immunodeficiency virus type 1 activities and pharmacokinetics of novel 6 substituted acyclouridine derivatives.
The novel 6 substituted acyclouridine derivatives 1 [(2 hydroxyethoxy)methyl] 6 phenylthiothymine (HEPT), 1 [(2 hydroxyethoxy)methyl] 6 (3 methylphenylthio)thymine (HEPT M), 6 cyclohexylthio 1 [(2 hydroxyethoxy) methyl]thymine (HEPT H), and 1 [(2 hydroxyethoxy)methyl] 6 phenylthio 2  thiothymine (HEPT S) have proved to be potent and selective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) replication in a variety of cell systems, including peripheral blood lymphocytes. They are not inhibitory to the replication of HIV 2. HEPT S emerged as the most active congener, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 1.6 microM for HIV 1 (human T cell lymphotropic virus type IIIB) in MT 4 cells. We also examined the pharmacokinetics of the compounds following oral administration to rats. The pharmacokinetic profile varied considerably from one compound to another. The highest concentration in plasma (7.4 micrograms/ml, or 22.8 microM) was achieved by HEPT S within 30 min after administration of an oral dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight. HEPT S can be considered a promising candidate for the treatment of HIV 1 infections.
