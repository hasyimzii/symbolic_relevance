Effect of streptozotocin diabetes on the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis in the rat.
Studies of the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis have been performed in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic Wistar rats and their controls. Plasma PBI concentration, plasma and pituitary TSH, contents, and hypothalamic TRH content were measured by RIA in basal and stimulated conditions. Compared to controls, rats made diabetic by 6.0 or 7.5 mg STZ/100 g BW showed decreased plasma PBI and TSH and diminished pituitary TSH content, with greater alterations in rats receiving the highest STZ dose. Both diabetic groups showed an almost 50% reduction of hypothalamic TRH content in comparison with the mean control value. After thyroidectomy, pituitary TSH secretion increased in diabetic, ad libitum fed, and semistarved animals, but it was lower in the diabetic group in which the reduction in plasma PBI was similar or greater. To evaluate pituitary sensitivity to the inhibitory action of L T4 on TSH secretion in diabetes, thyroidectomized control (Thx C), thyroidectomized diabetic (Thx D), and thyroidectomized semistarved (Thx S) rats were injected twice daily for 7 days with either saline or a fractional L T4 dose of 0.25, 0.50, or 1.00 microgram/100 microgram/100 g BW. In Thx D rats, a daily dose of 1.00 microgram L T4 was sufficient to normalize pituitary TSH secretion, while a dose of 2.00 microgram was required to induce a similar effect in the Thx C and Thx S animals. Pituitary TSH content was increased in the Thx C group with increasing T4 doses. No modification in this parameter was seen in the Thx D and Thx S animals. The fact that diabetes caused a reduction in the hypothalamic TRH content indicates that the primary cause of pituitary thyroid alterations in STZ diabetic rats lies in the hypothalamus, although the metabolic imbalance induced by diabetes and, in less degree, by undernutrition could also be partly responsible for some of the described modifications.
