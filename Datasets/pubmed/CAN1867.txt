Coexpression of a mutant beta actin and the two normal beta  and gamma cytoplasmic actins in a stably transformed human cell line.
HUT 14 is a cloned transformed cell line derived from normal diploid human KD fibroblasts. HUT 14 cells have an altered actin phenotype. In addition to the two nonmuscle actins beta and gamma, also present in the parent KD cells, they show the stable expression of a novel actin species (Ax actin). Amino acid sequence analysis has been used to identify the three actins of HUT 14 cells. beta  and gamma actins are identified as normal mammalian nonmuscle actins whereas Ax actin is characterized as a beta actin mutant revealing a single amino acid substitution at position 244. The results obtained are compatible with a simple mutational event involving a point mutation in one of the two beta nonmuscle actin genes assumed to be present in proliferating human diploid fibroblasts. Certain emerging principles of nonmuscle actin gene expression in higher vertebrates are discussed.
