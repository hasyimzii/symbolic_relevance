Physicians' and families' perspectives on the medical management of dementia.
The role of physicians in the long term management of patients with the primary diagnosis of progressive dementia was investigated by surveying the opinions of 57 physicians and 47 family members. Respondents were asked to evaluate the difficulty and helpfulness of various activities physicians perform in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients with dementia. Both physicians and families rated the diagnostic services provided by physicians very highly. Although families found physicians' explanations of the diagnosis and prognosis extremely helpful, physicians reported this as an area of difficulty. Physicians and families expressed considerable frustration with the limited medical treatments and interventions for the relief of symptoms associated with dementia. Despite the acknowledged sensitivity of physicians to the social psychological consequences of dementia, physicians were found to be least helpful in addressing these issues, either directly or through referral to allied health and social services. This study outlines areas of physician education that need improvement and calls for development of an interdisciplinary network of services for the biopsychosocial management of dementia.
