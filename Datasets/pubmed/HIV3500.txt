Quaternary structure of the immunostimulating complex (iscom).
Proteins of either HIV 1, hepatitis B, or rabies virus were incorporated with the adjuvant substance Quil A and cholesterol into the immunostimulating complex: iscom. Formation and symmetry of this regular complex were analyzed by electron microscopy. Micellar structures with a diameter of about 12 nm, occasionally with a 7 nm stain filled center, were formed in a 0.03% water suspension of Quil A. Cavities or holes appeared in the smooth structures of cholesterol upon the addition of Quil A, and after mixing Quil A and cholesterol 1:1 fragile and flattened structures of matrix were produced with a diameter of about 40 nm. By freeze drying the matrix was preserved as a cage like, isometric particle. Stable iscom particles composed of Quil A, cholesterol, and selected viral proteins had an approximate diameter of 32 nm. The particles had an uniform, cage like structure, exhibiting icosahedral symmetry, irrespective of the viral proteins incorporated. Tilting experiments and rotational image analysis indicated that the iscoms were composed of 20 morphological subunits assembled in a pentagonal dodecahedron with a hole on each of the 12 pentagonal faces. The symmetrical shape of the iscom might explain both its remarkable stability and its capacity to efficiently present antigens to the immune system.
