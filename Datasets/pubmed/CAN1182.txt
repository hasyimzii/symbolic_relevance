Melanoma in Otago and Southland.
Three hundred and twenty patients with malignant melanoma were treated in Otago and Southland during the 10 years 1968 to 1977. Retrospective examination of available information showed a greater frequency in women than in men. The overall incidence of the area increased from 6.2 per 100 000 at the beginning of the study, to 12.8 per 100 000 in 1977. The five year survival rate was 76 percent overall, and 83 percent for superficial invasion (levels I to III). The only factor significantly affecting prognosis was old age, which diminished the five year survival rate.
