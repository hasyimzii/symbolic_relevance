The 200  and 150 kDa neurofilament proteins react with IgG autoantibodies from patients with kuru, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, and other neurologic diseases.
Sera from 65 patients with spongiform virus encephalopathies (29 with kuru, 36 with Creutzfeldt Jakob disease), 79 with other neurologic diseases, and 65 control subjects were examined for reactivity in immunoblots of preparations of myelinated axons and neurofilaments from mouse brain. The sera reacted most frequently with the 200 kDa and 150 kDa neurofilament proteins and less frequently with the 70 kDa neurofilament protein and a 62 kDa neurofilament associated protein. The sera reacted with the same proteins as those which reacted with rabbit and mouse polyclonal antibodies and mouse monoclonal antibody to neurofilament proteins. Serum reactions were also seen with Trixon X 100 extracts of chimpanzee brain and bovine spinal cord but not with Triton extracts of liver, kidney, and muscle.
