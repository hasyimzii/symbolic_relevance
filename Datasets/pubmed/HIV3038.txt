Human T cell leukemia virus specific antigens.
Type I and type II human T cell leukemia viruses (HTLV) contain in their genomes  three structural genes, gag, pol, and env and a putative transforming gene, lor. Using a living cell membrane immunofluorescence assay, antibodies to surface expressed env gene products of HTLV MA have been detected in healthy carriers living in the HTLV I endemic areas, and in patients with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Similar antibody reactivities were detected in patient MO, from whom HTLV II was first isolated, and in a proportion of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Amino acid sequence homology between env gene products of HTLV I and HTLV II provides the molecular basis for the observed serological crossreactivity. Detection of HTLV specific antibody in a proportion of AIDS patients suggested that agents related to HTLV I may be the etiological cause of AIDS. Several lines of evidence have now suggested that HTLV III is the etiological agent of AIDS. Flanked by the env gene and 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) is a region originally described by Seiki et al. as "X." A 42 kdalton and a 38 kdalton product have been detected in HTLV I and HTLV II transformed cells, respectively. These two proteins appear to be translated from a long open reading (lor) frame in the X region, and from a yet to be defined region upstream to the lor gene. The identification of lor products provides direct evidence for the presence of previously unidentified functional genes in HTLV I and HTLV II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
