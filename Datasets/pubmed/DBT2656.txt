Lecithin sphingomyelin ratio and RDS in patients with diabetes mellitus: possible mechanisms.
Controversy exists concerning the positive correlation of maternal diabetes mellitus and the propensity for the progeny to develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The increased incidence of RDS in these offspring seems to occur despite the various physical and biochemical assessments which indicate a mature lung profile. Recent data seem to incriminate insulin antagonism of normal fetal physiologic processes as the principal culprit. Strict control of maternal glucose metabolism in the pregnant diabetic may be essential in reducing RDS in the infant of a diabetic mother.
