Immunological changes in beta thalassemia major patients positive for HTLV III antibodies.
Antibodies to HTLV III were found in 6 of 206 Sicilian patients with thalassemia  major, aged 1 to 30 years. None of the patients showed clinical signs related to immuno deficiency syndromes. Immunological investigations carried out in all positive patients showed alterations similar to those found in thalassemic patients without antibodies to HTLV III. These immunological changes could not depend on the HTLV III infection, but could be related to the thalassemic condition.
