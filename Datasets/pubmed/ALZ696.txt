Evaluation of zimeldine in Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive and biochemical measures.
Neuropsychological and neurochemical effects of zimeldine, a relatively specific  serotonin reuptake blocker, were examined in four patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, in a double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study. Individualized doses of zimeldine were administered to achieve target plasma zimeldine concentrations of approximately 50 (low) to 100 (high) ng/mL. Overall, there was no significant effect of zimeldine on memory or reaction time measures as compared with placebo. The drug significantly reduced (by up to 38%) 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in the cereobrospinal fluid and almost abolished (90% reduction) platelet serotonin uptake. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of 3 methoxy 4 hydroxy phenylglycol, a major metabolite of norepinephrine, and homovanillic acid, the major metabolite of dopamine, were not altered. Our findings indicate that alterations in central and peripheral serotoninergic function by a serotonin reuptake blocker (zimeldine) are unaccompanied by measurable changes in memory and/or reaction time in patients presumed to have Alzheimer's disease.
