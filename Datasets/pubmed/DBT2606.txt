Diabetic gastroparesis.
It is reported on a 61 year old patient in whom since 1959 has been existing a diabetes mellitus in need of insulin. 1973 in the endoscopic control of roentgenological findings of a stomach suspect to tumour by means of the Wolf Schindler gastroscope the suspicion to a gastric carcinoma was expressed. In May 1975 he was again admitted to hospital on account of a hypoglycemic shock. Roentgenologically large filling defects in the stomach were found, gastroscopically macroscopically no clearly explained whitish yellow masses (Histology: remains of food, chronic superficial gastritis, extended settlement of fungi). Only after several days of food carency and daily gastric lavages gastroscopically normal findings could be made. Together with the roentgenological findings of the stomach the diagnosis gastroparesis diabeticorum was made. Therapeutically an optimum stopping of diabetes is recommended and the application of metoclopramide. A surgical intervention is not advisable.
