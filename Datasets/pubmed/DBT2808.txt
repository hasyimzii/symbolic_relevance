Critical analysis of the 2 hour test in mass screenings for the early detection  of diabetes.
Out of 500 random trial subjects, taken for a mass screening for early detection  of diabetes mellitus, the Authors tried a correlation between the reliability of the "two hour test" and the 2 h OGTT. The latter method provides more reliable results, allowing us to diagnose a high percentage of cases which is not possible if the simple two hour test were used. Research of glycosuria in the course of OGTT did not show any real reliability, whereas it did prove useful in the preliminary phase of our research in order to distinguish the subjects for whom a deeper investigation would be advisable.
