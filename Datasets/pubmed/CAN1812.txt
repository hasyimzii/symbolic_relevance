Carcinoma of the bladder treated by partial or total cystectomy.
The results obtained in 37 patients treated by partial cystectomy and 51 patients treated by total cystectomy are presented. Partial cystectomy was usually performed for deeply invasive tumours. THere were no operative deaths, but 85% of the patients died in the first two years of follow up and the five year survival was 11%. Of the 51 patients having total cystectomy, 22 were operated upon after other treatments had failed. There were six (11.8%) operative deaths, only one following simple cystectomy, and the remainder following radical cystectomy with or without urethrectomy. Almost half the survivors died in the first two years, and the five year survival was 31%. The better prognosis in total cystectomy is attributable to the presence of a number of patients with multicentric but relatively non invasive tumours. Thirteen patients, all with invasive bladder tumours, had 4,000 R irradiation to the pelvis before operation. There was no benefit demonstrated in this combined treatment. The loss survival rate despite treatment in deeply invasive bladder tumours indicates the value of early diagnosis and the need for more effective forms of treatment.
