HIV related risk behaviour among a non clinic sample of injecting drug users.
This paper focuses upon HIV related risk behaviour among a sample of injecting drug users purchasing injecting equipment at a retail pharmacy in Glasgow. It is shown that the majority of the individuals interviewed were concerned about HIV/AIDS and that many were optimistic about their chances of avoiding contracting the virus. However, it is shown that the shared use of injecting equipment was continuing and that many individuals were prepared to provide their own injecting equipment to others, even if they were unprepared to re use it again themselves. We also consider here the possibility of encouraging drug injectors to switch to non injecting drug use and the potential basis for any sexual transmission between drug injectors and others. The paper concludes with a consideration of some of the policy implications of this work.
