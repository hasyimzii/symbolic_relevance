Antibodies to human T cell lymphotropic virus type III in promiscuous healthy homosexual men. Relation to immunological and clinical findings.
Antibodies to human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III Ab) were present in twenty one out of sixty four asymptomatic promiscuous homosexual men from Copenhagen. The presence of HTLV III Ab was associated with lymphadenopathy (P less than 0.0005), cytomegalovirus isolation (P less than 0.01), low skin test reactivity (P less than 0.01) and episodes of fever within the 2 month period prior to investigation (P less than 0.05). No significant differences occurred in the total number of T cells, T suppressor cytotoxic cells, T helper cells or helper to suppressor ratio (H/S ratio) between HTLV III Ab positive and negative homosexuals. An H/S ratio less than or equal to 1.0 was significantly more frequent in homosexual men who both had HTLV III Ab and excreted cytomegalovirus (P less than 0.01). The H/S ratio of HTLV III negative homosexuals were significantly lower than that of the controls suggesting that a non HTLV III related immunosuppression occurs among homosexuals. Within 2 years after the investigation AIDS or the AIDS related complex developed in three of the men, who at the first investigation all had HTLV III Ab, alterations in T lymphocyte subsets and cutaneous anergy. It is suggested that a combination of T cell subset determination and determination of HTLV III Ab may provide more valuable prognostic information than isolated determination of HTLV III Ab.
