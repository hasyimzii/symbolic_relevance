Lack of a negative influence on viral growth by the nef gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) contains an open reading frame called nef at the 3' end of its genome. The nef gene product has been reported to down regulate viral growth by suppressing viral transcription through interaction with the long terminal repeat region. We have compared two isogenic HIV 1 (HIV 1 WI3) strains, one of which lacks nef expression, and found little difference between them in in vitro growth. We tested effects on viral entry, DNA synthesis, and RNA expression by measuring HIV specific low molecular weight DNA and RNA after infection. The qualitative and quantitative aspects of DNA and RNA synthesis were comparable between the nef+ and nef  strains. The effects on viral growth were also examined by following changes in reverse transcriptase activity during the course of infection. The presence of the nef gene product failed to slow viral growth in several different cell types tested, including the human T lymphocyte cell lines H9 and CEM SS, human primary T cells enriched for CD4+ cells, and human monocytic cell lines U 937 and THP 1. On the contrary, the nef+ strain grew more efficiently in some cell types than the nef  strain. The same results were obtained with nef+ and nef  strains of a different virus, HIV 1 432, whose Nef had been reported to have a negative effect on viral growth. Our data suggest that the Nef protein does not act as a negative factor, at least in the experimental systems employed in our studies.
