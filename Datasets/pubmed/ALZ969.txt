Computerized EEG spectral analysis in elderly normal, demented and depressed subjects.
Computerized spectral analysis of the EEG was performed in 35 patients with Alzheimer's disease and compared to patients with major depression (23) and healthy elderly controls (61). Compared to controls, demented patients had a significant increase in the theta and alpha 1 bandwidths as well as an increased theta beta difference. The parasagittal mean frequency, beta 1 and beta 2 activity were significantly decreased. Depressed patients differed from demented patients, particularly at the lower end of the spectrum, having significantly less delta and theta activity. Like the demented group, depressed patients also had a decreased parasagittal mean frequency, beta 1 and beta 2 when compared to controls. In demented patients, there was a high correlation between several spectral parameters (parasagittal mean frequency, delta and theta activity, and the theta beta difference) and the Folstein score, EEG measures used for discriminant analysis were more accurate in identifying demented patients who had lower Folstein scores.
