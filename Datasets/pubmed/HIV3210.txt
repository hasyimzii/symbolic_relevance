Tumor promoter, TPA, enhances replication of HTLV III/LAV.
The incubation of Molt 4/HTLV III cells, human T lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III)/lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) producer cell line, with more than 0.5 ng/ml of 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate (TPA) for 2 to 4 days stimulated virus induced cell killing which resulted in a high production of HTLV III/LAV. TPA significantly increased the number of plaque forming viruses released from the cultures as well as viral RNA content. Interestingly, MT 4 cells freshly infected with HTLV III/LAV treated for 4 days with 0.125 to 2.0 ng/ml of TPA were found to retain the capacity to grow, because TPA inhibited the induction of the virus specific antigens and cytopathic effects. In contrast to the situation in infected MT 4 cells in liquid cultures, the addition of 0.125 and 0.25 ng/ml of TPA into agarose medium induced large plaques, suggesting that TPA basically enhanced the production of the virus from one infected MT 4 cell. Taken together, the data suggest that TPA enhances the replication of HTLV/III/LAV. These assay systems are shown to be useful for analyzing the induction or suppression of a virus infection by many drugs and other factors in vitro.
