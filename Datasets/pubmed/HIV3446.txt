Differential effects of nef on HIV replication: implications for viral pathogenesis in the host.
Stable lymphoid cell lines expressing the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) nef gene product, p27, were established. The presence of p27 in the lymphoid cells suppressed replication of some strains of both HIV 1 and HIV 2. This observation indicates that nef could be important in the establishment of HIV latency. In contrast, fast replicating and highly cytopathic HIV 1 isolates recovered from patients with advanced disease states were not affected by the negative effect of nef present in these lymphoid cell lines. This lack of response to nef appears to constitute another viral feature that correlates with disease progression. Thus, manipulating expression of the nef gene in vivo might influence pathogenesis in the host.
