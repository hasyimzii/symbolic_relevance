Ocular pathology for clinicians. 8. Orbital cellulitis.
Orbital cellulitis secondary to sinusitis has been the most common cause of proptosis in children. A case report is presented which emphasizes that the signs and laboratory findings in orbital cellulitis may be confusing, especially when modified by prior antibiotics. When orbital cellulitis is a possibility, adequate antibiotic therapy should be instituted while diagnostic studies are being performed. CT scanning is a new and useful modality for the evaluation of these patients, but cautious and experienced interpretation is essential. In patients who do not respond promptly to appropriate medical therapy, surgical intervention is indicated for drainage and biopsy.
