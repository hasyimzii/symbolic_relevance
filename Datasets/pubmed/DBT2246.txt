Interstitial hyperosmolarity may cause axis cylinder shrinkage in streptozotocin  diabetic nerve.
Maximal conduction velocity values of nerves of diabetic rats 20 weeks after streptozotocin intoxication were found to be intermediate between those of onset control and those of end control groups. The abnormality of conduction velocity of the streptozotocin group might therefore be attributed to a failure of maturation. Detailed electron microscopic morphometry of myelinated fibers (MFs) indicates that more than lack of maturation is involved. Whereas the number of lamellae and the perimeter of axis cylinders of myelinated fibers of the three study groups suggested that growth continues, cross sectional area of the axis cylinders of the streptozotocin group was smaller than those of either control group. Scored evaluation of fiber shape and the measured index of circularity, which related perimeter and transverse axis cylinder area, also indicated that a selective shrinkage of axis cylinders had occurred. This selective alteration in size and shape of axis cylinders is identical to that described after hyperosmolar fixation. Compared with that of controls, the serum of streptozotocin rats is hyperosmolar. It would seem reasonable to attribute the axis cylinder changes to shrinkage. Whether an additional maturational effect is operative as well cannot be resolved from our data.
