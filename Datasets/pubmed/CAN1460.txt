Development of an in vitro and in vivo epithelial tumor model for the study of invasion.
Three continuous cell lines were isolated from N [4 (5 nitro 2 furyl) 2 thiazolyl]formamide (FANFT) induced carcinoma of the Fischer rat urinary bladder by standard explant techniques. RBTCC 2 carcinoma cells were derived from a noninvasive FANFT tumor of Stage 0, RBTCC 5 carcinoma cells were from an invasive FANFT tumor of Stage B2, and RBTCC 8 carcinoma cells were from a s.c. metastasis of a FANFT tumor of Stage D2. Invasive and metastatic carcinoma cells were differentiated from their noninvasive counterparts by cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, cell size, nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, number of nucleoli, and abnormalities of occludens junctions. Using low (less than 10) and high (greater than 80) passages of these cell strains, tumorigenicity experiments in syngeneic rats showed that the normal in vivo progression of FANFT tumors was interrupted by the isolation of carcinoma cells to cell culture. Histological appearance and biological behavior of tumor isografts closely resembled those of the original FANFT tumors. This was best demonstrated when tumor cells were inoculated adjacent to rat femurs. The destruction of bone, monitored radiographically and histologically, served as a measure of the invasive potential of the tumor cells. Destruction and deep invasion were observed only with isografts of invasive and metastatic carcinoma cells, presumably due to collagenolytic activity. Despite rapid degradation of bone by these isografts, the natural resistance of cartilage to tumor invasion could not be overcome. These carcinoma cell lines, together with their normal epithelial counterparts and the major supporting cells of connective tissue characterized previously by our laboratory, provide a unique system to study tumor invasion.
