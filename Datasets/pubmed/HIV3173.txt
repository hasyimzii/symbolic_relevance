Human T cell lymphotropic virus type III infection of the central nervous system. A preliminary in situ analysis.
Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are subject to a spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Recent evidence implicates the human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III) in the pathogenesis of some of these illnesses, although, the cells infected by the virus have yet to be identified. Using in situ hybridization, we examined brain tissue from two patients with AIDS encephalopathy for the presence of HTLV III RNA. In both cases, viral RNA was detected and concentrated in, though not limited to, the white matter. The CNS cells most frequently infected included macrophages, pleomorphic microglia, and multinucleated giant cells. Less frequently, cells morphologically consistent with astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and rarely neurons were also infected. The findings strengthen the association of HTLV III with the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalopathy. In situ hybridization can be applied to routinely prepared biopsy tissue in the diagnosis of HTLV III infection of the CNS.
