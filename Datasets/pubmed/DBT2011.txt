Association of hyperlipidemia, acute pancreatitis and diabetic keto acidosis. A  case report (author's transl).
A 32 year old man was admitted semi comatose with digestive troubles to the hospital. A diabetic keto acidosis was discovered. The diabetes was known by the patient for one year and a half, but it was not treated. Furthermore the laboratory studies showed a hyperlipidemia (type V) and an increase in pancreatic enzymes. The hyperlipidemia disappeared with insulin therapy. The chronology of the facts was probably: a hyperlipidemia associated with the diabetes, responsible of an acute pancreatitis, which induced a keto acidosis.
