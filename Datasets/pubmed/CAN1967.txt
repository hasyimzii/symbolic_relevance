A case of insulin autoimmune syndrome associated with small insulinomas and rheumatoid arthritis.
Twenty five cases of insulin autoimmune syndrome including this case has been reported so far without having the pathogenesis clarified. This paper describes a case which suggests one aspect of pathogenesis. The patient, a housewife concurrently had insulinoma and severe rheumatoid arthritis, complaining of hypoglycemic syncope attacks. During the attacks her blood sugar levels ranged from 19 to 22 mg%. Her serum extractable immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and insulin binding antibody levels were 557 microunits/ml and 0.390 mU/ml, respectively. gamma Globulin bound insulin was also measured electrophoretically. Bio Gel P 10 column chromatography eluted almost all IRI at the void volume at pH 7.4 and a smaller but significant IRI peak also at pH 3.0. Selective angiography revealed a tumor like staining in the pancreas body. Pancreatectomy relieved her of hypoglycemic attacks. Histology disclosed two small insulinomas. Insulinoma, rheumatoid arthritis and insulin autoimmune syndrome coexisted in this case, suggesting some causal relationship among them.
