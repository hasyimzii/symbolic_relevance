Cardiac localizations of lymphomas. A case report and review of the literature (author's transl).
A case of malignant lymphoma with cardiovascular manifestations is reported. It is a febrile form with compression of the aortic ring provoking a murmur simulating aortic valve disease with an Osler's graft. An analysis of the various complications due to lymphomas reported in the published literature emphasizes the iatrogenic nature of some of them: cardiac toxicity of chemotherapy, post radiotherapy pericarditis, and increased incidence of coronaritis after both cobalt and radiotherapy. The diagnosis of lymphomas in the cardiac area is difficult but should be evoked in case of febrile and chronic cardiopathy, no other etiology being detectable.
