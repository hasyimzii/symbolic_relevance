Effect of buflomedil on behaviour, memory, and intellectual capacity in patients  with dementia. A placebo controlled study.
A double blind, placebo controlled clinical study of the efficacy and safety of buflomedil in the treatment of dementia was conducted in 55 patients. A statistically significant improvement was achieved for such characteristics as mood, self care, alertness, emotional lability, indifference, hostility, and anxiety. Compared with placebo, buflomedil showed a clear superiority with regard to improvement in cognitive dysfunction and psychosomatic dysfunction, with a trend toward statistical significance in improvement in interpersonal relations. Secondary analysis of a subset of patients without evidence of earlier cerebrovascular accident showed similar clinical responses and statistical findings. Buflomedil was well tolerated.
