Nucleus raphe dorsalis in parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam.
Recently, morphometric analysis has shown that the nucleus raphe dorsalis, which  is presumed to project diffuse serotonergic fibers to the telencephalon, is affected in Alzheimer's disease. A similar study was conducted in this report in two patients with parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam and a Guamanian control. It demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of large neurons, and the presence of abundant Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles in this nucleus.
