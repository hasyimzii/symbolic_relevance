Enhanced intestinal absorption of insulin in rats in the presence of sodium 5 methoxysalicylate.
Sodium 5 methoxysalicylate, previously shown to enhance the rectal absorption of  several drugs, facilitates the absorption of insulin from the upper gastrointestinal tract, resulting in significantly elevated insulin levels and lowered glucose concentrations in the plasma of rats. Restricting the movement of insulin and adjuvant down the intestine by either ligation or use of a more viscous vehicle further increased the absorption of insulin.
