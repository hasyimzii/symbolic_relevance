Association of B cell alloantigen with juvenile onset diabetes mellitus in the Japanese.
Sixty four Japanese insulin dependent juvenile onset diabetes mellitus (JOD) were studied in relation to HLA A, B, and DR. Significant deviations were observed. HLA Bw54 was increased (PF = 49.2%, RR = 6.4) and HLA B5 was decreased (PF = 7.9%, RR = 0.19). Using radioimmunoassay, two HLA DR antigens were investigated. Hon 7 antigen, so called MT3 (WIA4x7), which has linkage disequilibrium between HLA BW54, is highly associated (PF = 96.9%, RR = 27.8) with JOD found in the Japanese.
