Charcoal sorbent induced hypolipidemia in uremia and diabetes.
Rats with hyperlipidemia associated with streptozotocin induced diabetes or azotemia after subtotal nephrectomy were administered a diet containing 5% activated charcoal. Significant lowering of nonfasting serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels resulted. Charcoal feeding also altered the abnormal high density lipoprotein electrophoresis pattern of diabetic rats toward normal.
