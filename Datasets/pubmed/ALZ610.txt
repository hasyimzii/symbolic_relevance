Proteolytic fragments of Alzheimer's paired helical filaments.
We found that at least a part of Alzheimer's paired helical filaments (PHF) was cleaved by proteases to release three major polypeptides, the apparent molecular weights of which were 10K, 26K, and 36K daltons. These proteolytic fragments were strongly labeled with the antibodies specific to PHF. Absorption with highly purified PHF eliminated this labeling. The monospecific antibodies bound to the 10K daltons protein, the most intensely immunolabeled one, stained isolated neurofibrillary tangles composed of PHF. From these observations, we conclude that these polypeptides released by proteases, especially the 10K daltons protein, are derived from PHF themselves.
