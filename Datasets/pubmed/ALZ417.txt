Dopamine beta hydroxylase and acetylcholinesterase activities of cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease.
Recent neurochemical studies have indicated that in Alzheimer's disease there is  disturbance of the cholinergic metabolism of the brain. Defects in other transmitter systems have also been suggested. As a marker of noradrenergic metabolism of the central nervous system, we measured dopamine beta hydroxylase (EC. 1.14.17.1) activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 60 Alzheimer patients and 20 controls of the same age and sex. Dopamine beta hydroxylase activities of the CSF from Alzheimer patients did not differ significantly from those for the controls. The dopamine beta hydroxylase activities were not correlated with severity of dementia. As reported previously, the activity of a cholinergic marker, acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7), was reduced in the CSF of Alzheimer patients. Interestingly, dopamine beta hydroxylase activities were correlated with acetylcholinesterase activities both in Alzheimer patients and control group.
