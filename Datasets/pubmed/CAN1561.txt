Cavitary carcinomas of the lung with a pseudocystic aspect. Description of 2 clinical cases.
In this paper the Authors describe two cases of carcinoma of the lung with cavitary aspects that came under their observation. There are various hypotheses on the formation of such cavities: it is possible that the neoplastic cells may have a growth trend in a centrifugal direction, or that the cavity is due to a necroic colliquaive process of the mass itself or to extensive phenomena of autophagism. In other cases the neoplastic cells carpet already existing air cysts, giving the appearance of thin wall cavitation. It is precisely this type of cavitation that poses problems of differential diagnosis. In fact, when other instrumental investigations such as bronchoscopy or needle biopsy, always combined with cytology of the sputum, are not decisive, a relatively certain diagnosis can be obtained only by observing the evolution of the picture for some time, as was the case in the patients referred to above.
