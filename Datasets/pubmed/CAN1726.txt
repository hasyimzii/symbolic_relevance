The clinical picture and biochemical values in patients with arterial hypertension and concomitant hyperaldosteronism and low renin activity in blood plasma due to adenoma of the adrenocortical glomerular zone and in its absence were studied before and after surgical treatment. An attempt is made to substantiate the expediency of surgical or nonoperative treatment of patients with aldosteroma or bilateral hyperplastic process in the adrenals.
