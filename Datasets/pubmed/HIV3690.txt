The same 50 kDa cellular protein binds to the negative regulatory elements of the interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain gene and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat.
We have investigated the biochemical basis for negative regulation of interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain (IL 2R alpha) gene expression. Transient transfection studies employing internally deleted forms of the IL 2R alpha promoter localized a negative regulatory element (NRE) between nucleotides  400 and  368 relative to the major distal transcription start (cap) site. This 31 base pair (bp) element is involved in the attenuation of both basal and inducible IL 2R alpha promoter activity. Comparison of this IL 2R alpha NRE with other known regulatory motifs revealed an 11 bp core element (TTCATCCCAGG) that was strikingly similar to a protein binding domain within the long terminal repeat of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1). This viral domain has been previously implicated in the negative control of HIV 1 gene expression. In vitro protein DNA binding studies demonstrated that the same constitutively expressed approximately 50 kDa protein (SP 50) specifically bound to both the IL 2R alpha and HIV 1 NRE core elements. Mutation of the 11 bp IL 2R alpha NRE core element, which disrupted protein binding, significantly augmented basal as well as Tax protein  or phorbol ester induced IL 2R alpha promoter activity in vivo, suggesting that SP 50 functions as a transcriptional silencer.
