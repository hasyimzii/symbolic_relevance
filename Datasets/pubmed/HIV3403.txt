Protein A immunoadsorption therapy in HIV related immune thrombocytopenia: a preliminary report.
Nine homosexual patients with immune thrombocytopenia were treated with autologous plasma that had been perfused over silica immobilized Staphylococcus aureus protein A (SpA). Pretreatment platelet counts ranged from 10,000 to 98,000 cells/mm3 (mean: 54,000 cells/mm3). Six patients responded to therapy. Platelets increased by a mean of 95,000 cells/mm3 (p less than 0.007) and reached normal levels (greater than 150,000 cells/mm3) in four patients. Increased platelet counts are presently sustained in these four individuals after 5 months of follow up. Increases in platelet counts significantly correlated with decreases in platelet associated IgG (PAIgG), platelet directed IgG (PDIgG), and immune complexes (CIC). PAIgG and PDIgG declined by a mean of 67% (p less than 0.003) and 58% (p less than 0.007), respectively. CIC decreased by a mean of 37% (p = 0.02). Complement was concomitantly activated in all four examined patients. C3a and C5a increased 23 fold and 2.6 fold, respectively, while total hemolytic complement decreased by 50%. Activated complement components and removal of CIC and IgG thus may contribute to the platelet enhancing activity of SpA immunoadsorption therapy.
