Half life and hypoglycemic effect of intravenous insulin in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.
Intravenous insulin (0.3 U/kg body weight) was administered at 2 hour intervals to 34 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (21 women and 13 men; average age 34.4 years). Determination of blood glucose and plasma insulin values after the first two hours of treatment showed a decrease of both glycemia and plasma insulin values after the first two hours of treatment showed a decrease of both glycemia and insulinemia. Insulin half life was longer (15 min) than it is generally assumed (4  5 min). Discontinuous i.v. administration insulin in doses adapted to the "resistance to insulin" is deprived of risks, easy to apply and as effective as continuous i.v. infusion.
