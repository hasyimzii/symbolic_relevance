A rationale for studying the transmissibility of Alzheimer's disease.
Despite extensive chemical, epidemiological, histopathological and pharmacological investigations of Alzheimer's disease (AD), its etiology remains elusive. This article describes studies supporting a rationale for exploring a transmissible slow viral etiology of at least some forms of AD. To date, a major limitation in these studies has been reliance upon induction of AD histopathology as the outcome measure of successful transmission. Future studies should consider novel outcome measures for the detection of successful, although histopathologically inapparent, transmissible infection. In addition, the need to inoculate a diverse variety of rationally selected, potential hosts is stressed.
