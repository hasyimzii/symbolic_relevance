Why assess the aged? A clinical psychologist's view.
Four major areas of research: the early detection of Alzheimer's disease; the psychological side effects of anticholinergic drugs; the significance of late onset depression; and the relationship between physical activity, ageing and cognitive status, are discussed with reference to the problem of improving the quality of life in the aged. The four areas of research are unified by discussing two aspects of information processing: speed of performance and memory. The significance of and need for the assessment of cognitive status in the elderly are also discussed, as well as the notion that tests for the elderly should fit into their ecology.
