Synthesis and structure function studies of melanocyte stimulating hormone analogues modified in the 2 and 4(7) positions: comparison of activities on frog skin melanophores and melanoma adenylate cyclase.
The synthesis and purification of several analogues of the melanotropins with amino acid substitutions at the tyrosine 2 and methionine 4(7) positions are reported. The compounds synthesized included [4 norleucine] alpha MSH, [7 norleucine] beta p MSH, [2 3',5' diiodotyrosine] alpha MSH, [2 D tyrosine] alpha MSH, and [2 phenylalanine,4 norleucine] alpha MSH. The biological activities of these derivatives were measured and compared on normal melanocytes (frog skins) and on transformed melanocytes (mouse melanoma adenylate cyclase), over the entire dose response range. All compounds tested were full agonists in both assay systems but varied considerably in potency. The relative potencies in the frog skin assay (alpha MSH = 1.0) were as follows: [Nle7] beta p MSH (5.2) > [Nle4] alpha MSH (2.3) > alpha MSH (1.0) > [Phe2,Nle4] alpha MSH (0.80) > beta p MSH (0.55) > [I2 Tyr2] alpha MSH (0.12) > [D Tyr2] alpha MSH (0.04). The relative potencies in the melanoma adenylate cyclase system were [Nle7] beta p MSH (4.2) > beta p MSH (2.2) > [Nle4] alpha MSH (2.0) > alpha MSH (1.0) approximately equal to [Phe2,Nle4] alpha MSH (0.9) > [I2 Tyr2] alpha MSH (0.40) > [D Tyr2] alpha MSH (0.20). There appears to be some differences in structural specificity at the melanotropin receptors of the two cell systems.
