Synthesis and anti HIV evaluation of some phosphoramidate derivatives of AZT: studies on the effect of chain elongation on biological activity.
A series of phosphoramidate derivatives of the anti HIV drug AZT has been prepared as membrane soluble pro drugs of the bio active nucleotide forms and evaluated in vitro against HIV 1. Terminal substituted alkyl amines have a pronounced anti HIV effect: this effect declines upon increasing the length of the methylene spacer. The results are consistent with a mechanism of action involving intracellular cleavage of the phosphoramidate bond, and release of the nucleotide, or a derivative thereof. Full spectroscopic data are included on the products and their phosphorochloridate precursors.
