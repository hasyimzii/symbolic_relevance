Animal models of AIDS.
Animal models of AIDS are essential for understanding the pathogenesis of retrovirus induced immune deficiency and encephalopathy and for development and testing of new therapies and vaccines. AIDS and related disorders are etiologically linked to members of the lentivirus subfamily of retroviruses; these lymphocytopathic lentiviruses are designated human immuno deficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) and human immuno deficiency virus type 2 (HIV 2). The only animals susceptible to experimental HIV 1 infection are the chimpanzee, gibbon ape, and rabbit but AIDS like disease has not yet been reported in these species. Macaques can be persistently infected with some strains of HIV 2 but no AIDS like disease has resulted. It is not yet clear how suitable HIV infected SCID hu mice will be as a model for AIDS. Several subfamilies of naturally occurring cytopathic retroviruses cause immune suppression, including fatal immunodeficiency syndromes in chickens, mice, cats, and monkeys. Domestic cats suffer immunosuppression from both an onco virus, feline leukemia virus, and a member of the lentivirus subfamily, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Asian macaques are susceptible to fatal simian AIDS from a type D retrovirus, indigenous in macaques, and from a lentivirus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which is indigenous to healthy African monkeys. SIV is the animal lentivirus most closely related to HIV. Of these animal models, the lentivirus infections of cats (FIV) and macaques (SIV) appear to bear the closest similarity in their pathogenesis to HIV infection and AIDS. This review will summarize these various animal model systems for AIDS and illustrate their usefulness for antiviral therapy and vaccinology.
