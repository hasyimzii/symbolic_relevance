Dermatologic findings related to human immunodeficiency virus infection in high risk individuals.
A variety of dermatologic disorders have been associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This prospective study reports the frequency of mucocutaneous findings in 237 individuals at high risk for HIV infection, 33 of whom were HIV seropositive, during a follow up of 5 to 36 months; 12.1% of the study population, all of them HIV seronegative, were devoid of any pathologic changes of the skin or mucous membranes, whereas all HIV seropositive individuals exhibited one or several pathologic conditions during the observation period. Oral candidiasis, seborrheic and infectious eczematoid dermatitis, and acquired ichthyosis were among the most frequently encountered dermatologic disorders among the HIV seropositive individuals, and a worsening of the skin symptoms accompanied the clinical deterioration of the patients.
