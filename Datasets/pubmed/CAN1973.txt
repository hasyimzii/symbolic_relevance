Mouse sperm can horizontally transmit type C viruses.
Washed, non viable sperm from AKR and NZB mice contain infectious murine type C viruses (MuLV), whereas similarly treated sperm from Balb/c and probably C57Bl/6 mice do not. Interaction of washed, viable AKR, Balb/c and NZB sperm with tissue culture cells leads to a transfer of infectious MuLV to these cells. The most likely mechanism is infection by virus closely associated with the sperm. Another possible mechanism is the introduction of proviral DNA. These experiments indicate that type C viruses can be found with mouse sperm. They suggest sperm could horizontally transmit these MuLV to animals during copulation and to the germ line of mice during penetration of ova.
