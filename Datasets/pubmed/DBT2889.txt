Blood sugar controlled insulin infusion systems for rapid adjustment of insulin dependent diabetics (author's transl).
Empirically obtained data could be verified and the basis for assessment of total insulin requirement, circadian distribution of insulin doses and contents of single insulin portions of old and delayed action insulin could be established in a prospective study in 13 insulin dependent diabetics. Assessment of insulin requirements was done after a 36 hour investigation period with the artificial endocrine pancreas using standardised conditions. Readjustment was complemented by dietary advice and rearrangement of total calory input and distribution of carbohydrates during the day. Therapeutic success in 55 patients justifies this procedure. Adjustment of insulin dependent diabetics was thus obtained more rapidly, better and at less cost.
