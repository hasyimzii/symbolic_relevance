Needle biopsy of histoplasmosis.
A case of histoplasmosis, simulating a bronchogenic carcinoma, was needle biopsied. "Histoplasma capsulatum" organisms were found in great numbers. Needle biopsy established an accurate diagnosis making an exploratory thoracotomy unnecessary and preventing the patient from an already planned lobectomy. Specific treatment with Amphotericin B healed the lesion.
