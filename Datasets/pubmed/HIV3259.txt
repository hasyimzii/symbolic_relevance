Evidence for activation of complement in patients with AIDS related complex (ARC) and/or lymphoadenopathy syndrome (LAS).
The complement system was examined in 16 patients with AIDS related complex (ARC) (n = 5) and/or lymphoadenopathy syndrome (LAS) (n = 11). Of these patients 62.5% showed an impairment of classical and/or alternative pathway activity associated with the presence of cleavage fragments of C3 and/or B and a significant reduction of many complement factors. The data indicate pathological complement activation in these patients through the classical and/or alternative pathway. Complement activation was more severe in patients with ARC than in those with LAS, and greater in drug abusers than homosexuals. The lack of efficient complement in the patients can be considered an 'acquired complement deficiency' with possible importance in the failure to combat the HIV attack.
