Functional and neurochemical cortical cholinergic impairment following neurotoxic lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis in the rat.
The effect of kainic and quinolinic acid on cortical cholinergic function was examined following injections of these agents into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm) or into the frontoparietal cortex. The release of cortical 3H acetylcholine (3H ACh), high affinity choline uptake (HACU) and acetylcholinesterase was measured 7 days following injections of saline (control), kainic acid (4.7 nmoles) and quinolinic acid (60, 150 and 300 nmoles) into the nbm. These cortical cholinergic parameters were also examined after injections of saline (control), kainic acid (9.4 nmoles) and quinolinic acid (300 nmoles) into the fronto parietal cortex. The release of 3H ACh, HACU and AChE was significantly reduced in animals injected with kainic or quinolinic acid into the nbm. Histological examination of stained sections showed a loss of cell bodies in the region of the nbm and the globus pallidus. The size of the lesion produced by quinolinic acid was proportional to the dose injected into the nbm. In animals injected with kainic acid or quinolinic acid into the cerebral cortex, the release of 3H ACh, HACU and AChE was not significantly reduced when compared with control animals, although histological examination of stained cortical sections showed a marked loss of cortical neurons. The results show that quinolinic acid, an endogenous neuroexcitant, produces a deficit of cholinergic function similar to that described in the cortical tissue of patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer's type. The toxic effects of quinolinic acid on cortical cholinergic function are due to its action on cholinergic cell bodies in the nbm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
