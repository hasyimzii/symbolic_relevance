Medications to modify at home behavior of Alzheimer's patients.
Benzodiazepines are used often in elderly, anxious patients with or without dementia. Clearly efficacious and relatively safe, benzodiazepines should be considered the first line drugs of choice to treat anxiety associated with Alzheimer's disease. "Second generation" antidepressants, although considerably more expensive than the tricyclics, are of significant benefit in the elderly, primarily because of extremely low anticholinergic side effects.
