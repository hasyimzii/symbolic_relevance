Below knee amputation and rehabilitation of amputees.
Of 373 below knee amputations, the healing rate was 82 per cent, primary healing  occurring in 73.3 per cent. A permanent prosthesis was fitted on 283 patients. We attribute this success to the multidisciplinary team approach, the skilled surgical technique, the use of an intraoperative prosthesis and the patients motivation and cooperation.
