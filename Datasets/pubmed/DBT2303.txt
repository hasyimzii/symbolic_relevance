Staff manuals for teaching patients.
In addition to outlining what to teach patients, the Staff Manual for Teaching Patients with Diabetes and the Staff Manual for Teaching Patients with Hypertension outline how patient and family learning can be promoted. A chapter specifically on the teaching learning process is included in each manual with concrete examples relevant to the disease process being discussed. Each manual also includes a brief chapter on how to organize and set up patient education in a hospital setting using a team approach.
