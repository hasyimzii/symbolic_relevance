Functional purification and enzymic characterization of the RNA dependent DNA polymerase of human immunodeficiency virus.
The RNA dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was purified from sucrose density gradient banded virus by four successive procedures: anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography on oligo(dT) cellulose and adsorption chromatography on hydroxyapatite. The enzyme preparation was free of cellular DNA dependent DNA polymerase activity. The properties of HIV RDDP were determined with a variety of template primers. Generally, the enzyme used Mg2+ for optimal activity except with (Cm)n X (dG)12 18 as template primer. Kinetic data (Michaelis constant, Hill coefficient) were calculated for several substrates.
