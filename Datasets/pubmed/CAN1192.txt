Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava (author's transl).
A further case of leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava is described, bringing the total number reported in the published literature to 63. The tumor was located in the inter renal segment of the vena cava, and was effectively removed by excision combined with venous reconstruction, enabling conservation of the renal veins. These malignant tumors occur more frequently in women, and their symptomatology varies according to their location in either the upper, middle or lower area of the inferior vena cava. Upper segment tumors are revealed by a Budd Chiari syndrome or obstruction of the right atrium and are usually rapidly fatal. Middle and lower segment tumors can be treated surgically, if diagnosis is made early enough and cavography is conducted.
