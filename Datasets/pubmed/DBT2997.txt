Disorders of glucose metabolism and manifestation of diabetes during treatment of endogenous hypertriglyceridemias (author's transl).
Disturbances of glucose metabolism are frequent concomitant findings with hypertriglyceridemias (HTG). Whether the manifestation of diabetes mellitus is favored by it is, however, unknown. In an observation study disturbed glucose metabolism was present in 47 of 91 cases of HTG, without drug therapy of diabetes being carried out. The study shows that glucose metabolism disorders in HTG annually regress in about 3% of cases and about 0.6 to 0.7% of the cases require drug treatment. Since retrospective and prospective analyses show that development of glucose tolerance disorders is closely related to changes in triglyceride concentrations, HTG must be considered as factors favoring diabetes mellitus.
