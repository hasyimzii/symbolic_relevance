Absence of peliosis hepatis in patients receiving testosterone enanthate.
Fifty two autopsies of patients who had undergone hemodialysis and had received testosterone enanthate, were reviewed for evidence of peliosis hepatis and liver neoplasms. Eight (15%) pathologic liver were isolated. No peliosis, adenoma or hepatoma was identified. These findings suggest that, unlike the 17 alpha derivatives of testosterone, testosterone enanthate is not associated with morphologic changes in the liver.
