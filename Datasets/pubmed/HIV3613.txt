EEG findings during the course of HIV infection.
Clinical neurological complications in HIV infection (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) are seen in later stages of the disease. EEGs of 186 patients in different stages of HIV infection and of 44 HIV seronegative volunteers (total of 566 recordings) were evaluated visually; this revealed an increasing appearance of CNS dysfunction (slowing of background activity, focal and diffuse CNS dysfunction) associated with a progression of the disease. Slowing of background activity was already found in early stages of HIV infection. Additional focal and diffuse changes in the electrical activity of the brain are also seen with progression of the infection (LAS/ARC AIDS). The correlation between these electroencephalographic changes and HIV related clinical symptoms are non specific however, EEG recordings can be a valuable aid in following CNS dysfunction during the course of HIV infection.
