Immediate early gene region of human cytomegalovirus trans activates the promoter of human immunodeficiency virus.
Almost all homosexual patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are also actively infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). We have hypothesized that an interaction between HCMV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the agent that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, may exist at a molecular level and contribute to the manifestations of HIV infection. In this report, we demonstrate that the immediate early gene region of HCMV, in particular immediate early region 2, trans activates the expression of the bacterial gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase that is fused to the HIV long terminal repeat and carried by plasmid pHIV CAT. The HCMV immediate early trans activator increases the level of mRNA from the plasmid pHIV CAT. The sequences of HIV that are responsive to trans activation by the HCMV immediate early region are distinct from HIV sequences that required for response to the HIV tat. The stimulation of HIV gene expression by HCMV gene functions could enhance the consequences of HIV infection in persons with previous or concurrent HCMV infection.
