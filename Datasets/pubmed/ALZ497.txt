Helping families cope with Alzheimer's disease.
Many families of patients with Alzheimer's disease seem to undergo an intense five stage reaction process and to face several specific problems when coping with the onset and progression of this debilitating illness. Mental health professionals must provide families with education about Alzheimer's disease and with supportive guidance, so that family members will successfully work through their reactions and be able to mourn their loved one, make necessary decisions for his care, and reestablish family equilibrium. The authors describe the reaction process and how mental health professionals can help during each stage, present a case example of a family coping with the disease, and discuss the specific problems that families must face and work through.
