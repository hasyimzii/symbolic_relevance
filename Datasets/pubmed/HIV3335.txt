Use of intravenous acyclovir for treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in patients at risk for AIDS.
Patients who are homosexual, intravenous drug abusers, or have received multiple  blood transfusions are at greater risk to contract the immunosuppressive disorders of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS related complex (ARC). These persons also have a greater chance of developing serious neurologic complications after an episode of Herpes zoster. We present two cases which emphasize the serious complications of Herpes zoster ophthalmicus in such patients. Since systemically administered acyclovir may shorten the disease course and reduce the complications of Herpes zoster in immunocompromised individuals, the authors favor treatment of all such patients who have Herpes zoster ophthalmicus with a seven day course of high dose (30 mg/kg/day) intravenous acyclovir. To minimize serious neurologic complications in such patients, treatment should be instituted immediately before the results of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing are known.
