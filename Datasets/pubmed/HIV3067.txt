AIDS in two African children  one with fibrosarcoma of the liver.
We report here on two black African girls who developed an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The first patient was a premature girl born to healthy parents. She suffered from interstitial pneumonitis during the first week of life and died of it at the age of 6 months. Her mother, although asymptomatic, had polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia, a reversed T helper/T suppressor ratio and a decreased lymphocyte response to mitogens. The second patient had the first symptoms at the age of 6 years, developed a primitive malignant fibrosarcoma of the liver at 8 years old and died 1 year later. AIDS can affect black African children who have not been transfused and whose family members are not considered as at a high risk for this disease. In children, AIDS and cancer can be associated. In the second patient, cytotoxic suppressor lymphocytes (OKT8 positive cells) were shown to behave in vitro as precursors of T killer cells.
