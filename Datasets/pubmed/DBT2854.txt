Clinical, biological, histological, ultrastructural and therapeutic studies in one case (author's transl).
The diagnosis of glucagonoma was made in a 51 year old woman who suffered from a  polymorphous dermatitis and an insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Denutrition was present and there was a previous history of thrombo embolism. Immunoreactive plasma glucagon was constantly higher than 1 000 pg/ml (N less than 175). Plasma aminoacids were low. After angiographic confirmation, the tumour and part of its hepatic metastases were resected. The dermatitis disappeared soon after. Its recurrence required chemotherapy (successively mithramycin, streptozotocin, DTIC) and good clinical results were obtained. On histological examination, the cutaneous lesions consisted of an epidermal edema, and a bullous intra epidermic detachment. The pancreatic tumour was of the trabecular type with a very important sclerosis. On electron microscopy, the tumoral cells, some with a syncitial aspect, contained granules of the D1 type. These granules are different from the typical glucagon granules. The clinical and biological features in this case are compared with those of the 41 cases of glucagonoma previously published.
