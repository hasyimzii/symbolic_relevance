Nonsecretory multiple myeloma in a 26 year old man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, presenting with multiple extramedullary plasmacytomas and osteolytic bone disease.
High grade B cell lymphoma and leukemia have been well described in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Malignant transformation of more differentiated lymphoid cells has not been well described in these patients. We report a 26 year old man with AIDS associated multiple myeloma, who had a highly unusual presentation and clinical course. A review of the literature indicates that monoclonal gammopathy in patients seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is common. Multiple myeloma and extramedullary plasmacytomas, diseases that are extraordinarily rare in young persons, are now being reported in patients with AIDS and should be added to the list of neoplastic diseases now associated with HIV infection.
