HIV occupational risk of surgical specialists and operating room personnel in the Saint Lucas Hospital in Amsterdam.
All instrument and needle accidents, and mucosal exposure to blood involving surgical specialists and operating room personnel were recorded for a seven month period in a middle sized Amsterdam hospital, the St. Lucas. Fifty four accidents were reported, of which 42 were percutaneous wounds and 12, blood splatters in the eyes. The frequency of percutaneous wounds per operation per person ranged from 0 to 0.013. In the same period 3098 patients who had to be operated on were asked to participate in an anonymous study for HIV antibody. One hundred and twenty patients refused participation (3.9%). Of the 2978 participating patients seven were seropositive for anti HIV (0.23%). The observed percutaneous accident frequency and HIV prevalence were used in combination with reports from the literature on the risk of infection after a single exposure to HIV infected material, to calculate the HIV professional risk for operating room personnel in this hospital. For general surgeons the risk of infection (based on 500 operations per year) was calculated as 0.0012 for an occupational lifespan of 30 years. For the other specialists and functions the risk was the same or less. Considering the low risk our conclusion is that screening of preoperative patients is not necessary in this hospital. The observance of general protective measures provides sufficient protection for the professional group examined.
