A highly divergent HIV 2 related isolate.
It has been suggested that the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV 2) and the simian immunodeficiency virus from rhesus macaques (SIVmac) evolved from the sooty mangabey virus SIVsm (ref. 1). We now describe an HIV 2 related isolate, HIV 2 D205, from a healthy Ghanaian woman that is genetically equidistant to the prototypic HIV 2 strains and to SIVsm and SIVmac. Supported by the observation that HIV 2D205 differs in a step of envelope glycoprotein processing, our data indicate that it could represent an alternative HIV 2 subtype and that viruses of the HIV 2/SIVsm/SIVmac group could have already infected humans before HIV 2 and SIVsm/SIVmac diverged.
