Comparison of endothelial cell density in diabetics and a control population.
We compared the endothelial cell density of 96 corneas from 52 diabetics with proliferative diabetic retinopathy with 61 corneas from 32 normal subjects by specular microscopy. Although the regression curve of the diabetic group was steeper, we found no statistically significant difference in endothelial cell density between the two groups.
