Fluorescein angiography in diabetic children. A follow up.
The present study is a fluorescein angiographic follow up of 60 diabetic children (aged 12    16 years). At the follow up, with two thirds of the children in pubescence, fluorescein angiography revealed diabetic retinopathy in 10 (17%) of the children. The results indicate puberty as a probable determining factor influencing the onset of the diabetic retinopathy.
