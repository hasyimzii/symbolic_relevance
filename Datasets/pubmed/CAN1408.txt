Histogenesis and morphology of naturally occurring prostatic carcinoma in the ACI/segHapBR rat.
The prostates of 201 male virgin or breeder ACI (ACI/segHapBR) rats, 24 to 40 months of age were reviewed histologically, and the genesis of prostatic carcinoma was studied. At 24 months of age, 35 to 45 per cent of the rats had the earliest lesions, intraalveolar atypical hyperplasias. These lesions progressed to intraalveolar cribriform carcinomas which spread along alveoli and ducts. As the tumors enlarged, they became nodular and invaded the capsule or adjacent tissues. By 33 months, 95 to 100 per cent of the rats had intraalveolar prostatic atypical hyperplasias, and 35 to 40 per cent had invasive carcinomas. There was no difference between the incidence of these tumors in virgin or breeder rats. The ACI rat is unique model for studying the etiology and pathogenesis of naturally occurring prostatic cancer.
