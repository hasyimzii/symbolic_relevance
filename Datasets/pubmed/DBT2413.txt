Transient like function and associated retinal capillary anomalies. Analysis of a patient with early retinopathy secondary to juvenile onset diabetes mellitus.
A juvenile diabetes patient exhibiting limited early microvascular changes in the retina has been studied intensively. Like some others showing early signs of diabetic retinopathy, he manifests anomalies in a retinally based transient like function. At all points tested in this case the sustained like function was found to be normal. Because his functional and anatomic anomalies are stable and cover a reasonably extensive area of visual field and retina, it is possible to attempt correlative studies with other visual response functions. The transient like function proves to be a more sensitive indicator of anomaly in this patient than static perimetry or critical flicker frequency.
