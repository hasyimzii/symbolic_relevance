Genital tuberculosis in women. Analysis of 187 newly diagnosed cases from 47 Swedish hospitals during the ten year period 1968 to 1977.
A retrospective analysis of symptomatology, diagnostic procedures, and treatment  of all 155 new cases of genital tuberculosis at 47 Swedish gynecology departments in the period 1968 77 was performed. The frequency of genital tuberculosis was 0.002% of all patients admitted for gynecologic disease. Genital tuberculosis occurred more frequently in the postmenopausal period. The most common symptoms were metorrhagia, pain, and infertility. Chemotherapy alone was used in 40% of the cases. Conservative surgery was attempted in 8%, and 38% had radical surgery. No intrauterine and four tubal pregnancies occurred after therapy. We conclude that primary treatment should be conservative, although the chances of having a normal pregnancy are almost nil and the risk of an ectopic pregnancy is great.
