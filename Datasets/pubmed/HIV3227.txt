Characterization and epitope mapping of a human monoclonal antibody reactive with the envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus.
A human monoclonal antibody (IgG2, lambda), 1B8.env, was produced, reactive with  the envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The antibody specifically stains cells infected with HIV, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence analysis and reacts with determinants displayed on the surface of infected cells. In Western blot analysis, the antibody reacts with bands of 160 and 41 kD, consistent with the precursor and transmembrane forms of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. The antibody also reacts specifically in immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis with cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus VSC 25, which contains the envelope gene of HIV. With the lambda gt11 expression vector, the epitope recognized by 1B8.env was mapped to a region of 11 amino acids in the coding region of gp41. This domain is highly conserved between several otherwise highly variable HIV isolates. In addition, this epitope appears to be recognized by the vast majority of HIV seropositive individuals. Although antibody IB8.env does not neutralize HIV virion infectivity or virally mediated cell fusion, the results presented here demonstrate the feasibility of generating and characterizing human monoclonal antibodies to HIV with these techniques. Additional antibodies produced in this manner will help to further characterize the humoral response to HIV infection, define biologically significant determinants on HIV proteins, and may be useful in clinical applications.
