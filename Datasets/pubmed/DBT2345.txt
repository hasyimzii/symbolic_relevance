Effects of jejuno ileal bypass on serum lipoproteins and glucose tolerance in severely obese patients.
Plasma insulin and blood glucose during oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and serial determinations of serum lipoprotein fractions before and after jejuno ileostomy in twenty severely obese (mean weight 137 kg) patients with a mean age of 29 years revealed statistically significant postoperative decreases in all parameters concomitant with a mean weight loss of 42 kg. Before the operation the patients were hyperinsulinaemic and had elevated blood glucose levels during OGTT though no patient had overt diabetes. Serum triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were normal but HDL cholesterol was significantly lower than in controls. During follow up at least until body weight had levelled off a mean 19 months post operative, there were statistically significant reductions in blood glucose and plasma insulin as well as serum total cholesterol and lipoprotein fractions. There was no change in serum triglycerides. The low preoperative HDL levels decreased. In a subgroup of these patients we have earlier shown postoperative increases in arterial tissue cholesterol coincident with the present significant decreases in HDL as well as in LDL cholesterol. Correlations between total cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol values in serum and blood glucose and plasma insulin at fast and during OGTT and changes in these parameters demonstrate interrelationships between lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. The bypass procedure most likely reduces the intestinal synthesis of HDL which in turn may increase hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Evidently there is a multifactorial aetiology for the low HDL levels in the severely obese both before and after jejuno ileostomy.
