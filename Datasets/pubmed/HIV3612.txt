EEG topography in HIV positive hemophiliacs.
HIV central nervous system manifestations, here the AIDS Dementia complex, are at the moment of special interest owing to its unexpected development. With EEG topography one can expect to gain more information about possible changes in frequency according to topographical location. We recorded 69 HIV positive hemophiliacs (23 WR 2, 26 WR 3 5 and 6 patients) plus 50 HIV seronegative controls with a 12 channel EEG topography evaluation. During the critical examination we looked for the results of two parameters: a) alpha 1 3/alpha 4 and b) alpha 4 4/9. In comparison to the control group we found a statistical significance (p less than 0.05) for WR 2 6 in alpha 1 3/alpha 4 index. Concerning the alpha 1 4/9 index one can only recognize a statistical significance (p less than 0.05) for WR 3 6 patients in comparison to the controls.
