HIV transmission and risk behavior among drug addicts at a treatment institution in Copenhagen (Klub 47).
From autumn 1985 until 31.12.1988, 127 drug addicts were examined for HIV antibodies. Twenty five (19.7%) were positive. No connection was found between age, sex and HIV status. The incidence of positive test results fell from 32.8% in 1985/1986 to 0% in 1988. From autumn 1987, 49 drug addicts completed a questionnaire about risk behaviour as regards sharing syringes or needles during the month prior to commencement of treatment. Thirty nine had no risk behaviour and the remainder very limited risk behaviour. The majority had reduced their risk behaviour on account of AIDS. Drug addicts have shown their will and abilities to reduce their risk behaviour. It is thus important to continue the informative efforts and prescription of syringes and needles. The therapeutic efforts should be extended with the object of preventing further infection in drug addicts and heterosexual and perinatal infection from the infected drug addicts.
