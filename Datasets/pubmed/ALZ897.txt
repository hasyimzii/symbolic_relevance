Neuropeptides in the brain.
In recent years, there has been a remarkable increase in the identification of neuropeptides. These peptides have become known as neuropeptides, as they have been identified within neuronal structures and frequently localised to nerve terminals. Classification of newly discovered peptides is attempted according to function or structure. Although the role of the hypothalamic releasing factors is readily appreciated, the functional significance of the remaining neuropeptides is often not easily determined. However, these peptide appear to interact with conventional transmitters and may be implicated in neuropathology.
