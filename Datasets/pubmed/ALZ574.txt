CSF somatostatin in Alzheimer's disease.
Studies have previously demonstrated low somatostatin levels in autopsy cortical  tissue from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and low somatostatin levels in CSF obtained from subjects with dementia. We evaluated levels of this peptide in 21 non depressed subjects, 10 with AD, 2 with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 9 with other neurological conditions. The AD patients had significantly lower mean CSF somatostatin than the "other" neurological patients (14.6 +/  1.5 S.E.M. versus 26.7 +/  3.2 pg/ml, p less than 0.005). A demented PD subject had a level in the range of the AD group, while the non demented PD patient had a value above this range. Thus, all 11 patients with AD or PD dementia, analogous disorders, had levels below 21.8 mg/ml, while 7 of the 10 remaining patients had values above 21.8 pg/ml. Age did not explain this finding.
