Hepatitis B virus reactivation or reinfection associated with HIV 1 infection.
Following acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, most individuals develop antibodies to HBV surface (anti HBs) and core antigen (anti HBc). Prevalence studies have shown that 10 18% develop anti HBc in the absence of detectable anti HBs. We report four such cases, all with persistence of serum anti HBc, who had evidence of a second period of active HBV replication as demonstrated by the reappearance of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). In one patient, an HBsAg subtype difference indicated that the second period of HBsAg positivity was due to a reinfection. In the other cases, reactivation may also explain the findings. All cases were anti HIV 1 seropositive at the time of reappearance of HBsAg. There is experimental evidence that anti HBc has a protective effect against HBV infection; however, this may require intact cell mediated immunity to be effective. HIV 1 infection may render such patients susceptible to reinfection. Alternatively, some patients with anti HBc, but without detectable anti HBs may have latent HBV infection. Immunosuppression associated with HIV 1 infection may allow reactivation.
