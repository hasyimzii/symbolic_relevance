A clinical trial with desglycinamide arginine vasopressin for the treatment of memory disorders in man.
In a double blind cross over trial the memory effect of the neuropeptide desglycinamide arginine vasopressin (DGAVP) was selected because of its well documented facilitatory effects on memory components in rodents. Patients with stabilized or progressive amnesic disorders (Korsakoff disease, early stages of Alzheimer dementia, head injuries and other central nervous system diseases) did not respond to the drug. Factors possibly explaining the discrepancy with animal research are discussed.
