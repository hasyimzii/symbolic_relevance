Diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.
The primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is one of the most frequent endocrine diseases and is characterized of various forms of manifestations. In 50 patients there was made a screening test to verify a pHPT in patients with recurrent calcium urolithiasis. In 4 patients a strong suspicion existed on pHPT, in 9 patients occured a normalcalcemic pHPT. Since the parathyroid hormone concentrations were measured by predominantly amino terminal directed antiserum the results must be considered critically.
