A plea for conservation of kidney in renal adenocarcinoma associated with von Hippel Lindau disease.
We report 3 cases of bilateral renal cell carcinoma associated with von Hippel Lindau disease. Treatment consisted of local excision or simply shelling out of the lesion from the surrounding tissue. The 3 patients are free of disease (followup 6 to 36 months). Although multifocal the lesions are removed easily; thus, normal renal function is preserved and patients are spared the morbidity and mortality associated with hemodialysis or transplantation.
