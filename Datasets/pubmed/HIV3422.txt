Patterns of serologic response to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) in Brazilians with different clinical forms of HIV infection.
In order to investigate the IgG HIV 1 antibodies reactivity to structural components of the virus, 85 sera from infected Brazilians, comprising the total spectrum of HIV infection, were analysed by Western blot assay. The sera were confirmed as being positive to HIV with enzyme linked immuno assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). Although the sera from patients reacted less intensively to the gag polypeptide of 55 KDa, no distinctive antigen reaction patterns were observed between sera patients with different clinical forms. Because of the higher frequency of reactivity to the gag p24 in AIDS patients, the patterns of anti HIV IgG responses are similar to those observed in their African counterparts.
