Cerebrospinal fluid acetylcholinesterase activity in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 36 individuals, including 12 persons with Alzheimer's disease, 12 normal controls, and 12 patients with other dementias. AChE activity also was measured in 47 normal subjects whose ages ranged from 20 to 84 to evaluate the effect of age on AChE activity. CSF from patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type showed significantly lower mean AChE activity than in age matched controls and patients with other dementia syndromes. No correlation was found between duration of illness, age, or severity of illness (as measured by the Mini Mental State Examination score) and CSF AChE activity in Alzheimer's disease. AChE increased significantly over the age range of 20 to 84. CSF AChE activity may prove to be a useful diagnostic test to confirm the clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.
