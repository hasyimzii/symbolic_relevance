Biologic gastric emptying time in diabetic patients, using Tc 99m labeled resin oatmeal with and without metoclopramide.
Biologic gastric emptying time (BGET) was measured in 24 patients with severe diabetes mellitus complicated by vascular damage and peripheral or sensory neuropathy. This population had a BGET of 192 +/  32.9 min (mean +/  s.e.m. normal 40 85 min). Patients with diabetic gastroenteropathy had prolongation of BGET to 295 +/  45 (p < 0.05). Metoclopramide significantly shortened BGET in this subgroup to 101 +/  40 min, with return to normal values in eight of the 12 patients given the drug. The Tc 99m labeled resin oatmeal test meal used as described in this study provides a reliable measure of BGET and of the response to metoclopramide.
