Ankle and foot fractures in diabetics provoking neuropathic joint changes.
Neuropathic joint changes, Charcot joints, in diabetics developing after ankle or foot fractures have received little attention in the literature. Three cases are presented here, one in a previously undiagnosed diabetic. The pathogenesis and the management are discussed, and the importance of adequate protection of these fractures is emphasized. Even fractures of the metatarsal bones should be immobilized and weight bearing must be postponed until the bone is firmly united.
