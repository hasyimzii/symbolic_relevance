Epidemics in perspective.
Irrational responses to patient with AIDS, particularly in regards to the transmissibility of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) are examined from an historical and psychosocial perspective. Although these responses are similar to those reported from past epidemics such as plague and leprosy, they are in direct conflict with our current level of understanding regarding the transmission of this virus. Their genesis may relate to the human penchant to react to illness metaphorically. In order to allay effectively public concern about the transmissibility of AIDS, it is essential to recognize the metaphor associated with venereal disease in general and AIDS in particular.
