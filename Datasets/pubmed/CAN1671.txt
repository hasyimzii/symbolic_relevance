Diagnostic value of determining carcino embryonic antigens in the aqueous humor  (author's transl).
Diagnostic tapping of the anterior chamber to determine the CEA count in aqueous  humor is discussed. Taking the serum aqueous humor barrier (filtration index) into account, it is possible to determine how much of this tumor antigen is produced locally. A case report illustrates the relevance of the method in a case of bilateral metastases of breast cancer in the choroid.
