Effect of liposomally entrapped insulin administered per os on the blood glucose level in normal and diabetic rats.
The article deals with the effect of insulin which was incorporated into lecithin cholesterol (molar ratio 9 : 2) liposomes, administered per os to normal and diabetic Wistar rats on the blood glucose level. The blood glucose level 1.5 h after the administration of insulin is shown to decrease significantly in diabetic rats. The maximum effect is observed 3 h after and then the blood glucose level gradually increases, being considerably lower than the control one 20 h after as well. Insulin in liposomes when given orally has no hypoglycaemic effect in the normal rats. A slight but statistically significant decrease in the blood glucose level is determined in the diabetic rats after administration per os of liposome absorbed insulin. The blood glucose level is practically the same as in the control when insulin is administered to the normal rats. Possible mechanisms of the insulin action in liposomes are discussed.
