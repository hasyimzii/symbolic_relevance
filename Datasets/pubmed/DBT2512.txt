Puerperal laparoscopic sterilization.
One hundred sixty eight cases of puerperal laparoscopic sterilization are presented. The operative technique, complications, and morbidity are discussed. Intraoperative and postoperative complications occurred in six patients (3.6%). Operative time (21 minutes) and postoperative stay (2.4 days) compared favorably with those of the concurrent series of 148 open postpartum ligations. It was concluded that puerperal laparoscopic sterilization in expert hands is a safe, viable alternative to laparotomy.
