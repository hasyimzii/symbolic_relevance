The role of penile Doppler sonography in impotent diabetics.
Penile systolic pressure has been evaluated by the Doppler sonographic method in  15 diabetic patients suffering from erectile impotence. Urodynamic tests have also been carried out in some patients for a diagnosis of neurological impotence. The results obtained show the possibility of a double or sole origin (neurogenic or vascular, or both) in the pathogenesis of this symptom in diabetic subjects.
