Dendritic changes in the basal nucleus of Meynert and in the diagonal band nucleus in Alzheimer's disease  a quantitative Golgi investigation.
Golgi impregnated reticular neurons and multipolar giant neurons, the two main classes of neurons in the basal nucleus of Meynert and in the diagonal band nucleus, were investigated morphometrically in five cases of Alzheimer's disease, and compared to controls. Both degenerative as well as regenerative neuronal changes were observed in cases of Alzheimer's disease. Degenerative changes such as irregular swellings and the fragmentation of dendrites are most pronounced on reticular neurons but can also be detected to a lesser extent on multipolar giant neurons. Regenerative changes are restricted to reticular neurons. They are characterized by the appearance of perisomatic filopodia, by an increase in the size of cell soma, by an increase in the degree of dendritic arborization and spatial extension of the dendritic tree. These regenerative changes are probably signs of a compensatory mechanism which might be induced by degeneration in this area.
