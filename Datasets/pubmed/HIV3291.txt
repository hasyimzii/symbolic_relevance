Superinduction of trans activation accounts for augmented human immunodeficiency  virus replication in HTLV I transformed cells.
Augmentation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in cells infected  with HTLVs has been demonstrated by cellular biological studies. Here, evidence is presented that this effect could be ascribed, at least in part, to the level of HIV gene expression.
