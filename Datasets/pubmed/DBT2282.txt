Flexion contractures in a diabetic child (Rosenbloom syndrome).
Limited movement in the fingers and in other joints of a diabetic boy is described. Although a slight contracture of the little finger was observed when diabetes was diagnosed, the progressive nature of the process was only clarified after 8 years. According to the results of te clinical findings the changes are the consequence of rigidity of the connective tissue. The vital capacity of the lungs was also diminished in our patient.
