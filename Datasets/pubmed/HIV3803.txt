Adolescents' attitudes towards AIDS precautions and intention to use condoms.
This study investigated attitudes toward AIDS precautions of 370 15  and 16 yr. old secondary school students. Attitudes reflected levels of apathy, denial, and confusion high enough to lead to concern for this potentially high risk group. Intention to use condoms in future sexual encounters was related to sex, conflict and confusion about AIDS precautions, plus other attitudinal variables.
