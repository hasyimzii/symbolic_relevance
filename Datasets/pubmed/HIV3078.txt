Female prostitutes: a risk group for infection with human T cell lymphotropic virus type III.
In July, 1984 33 female prostitutes in Rwanda and 25 male customers of prostitutes were assessed clinically and for their T lymphocyte subsets and frequency of antibodies to human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III). 27 healthy males who denied contact with prostitutes, 33 healthy women who were not prostitutes, and 51 Rwandese prostitutes seen in 1983 served as controls. Only 6 prostitutes were symptom free (group I), 13 had unexplained generalised lymphadenopathy (LAP) (group II), and 14 had LAP and constitutional symptoms (group III). Mean OKT4/OKT8 ratio in groups II and III was significantly lower than that in group I or in female controls. HTLV III antibodies were detected in 29 of 33 prostitutes, 4 female controls, 7 male customers, and 2 male controls. In male customers, HTLV III seropositivity increased according to the number of different sexual partners per year. This study suggests that in Central Africa prostitutes are a high risk group for HTLV III infection.
