Reanastomosis of end stoma and mucous fistula without formal laparotomy.
I describe a method of reestablishing bowel continuity by anastomosis of an end stoma and mucous fistula without formal laparotomy. Both the end colostomy or ileostomy and mucous fistula are mobilized and a tunnel is created by blunt dissection along the anterior parietal peritoneum between the two sites. The more easily mobilized stoma is then drawn through the tunnel and out the other site and the anastomosis is performed. Advantages of the procedure include zero mortality in the present series, very minimal morbidity, early ambulation, feeding, and discharge from the hospital as well as minimal postoperative discomfort. Six patients underwent this procedure during the past three years. All results were considered satisfactory. The use of the intraperitoneal tunnel is an effective and safe method of restoring bowel continuity that precludes many of the complications associated with long laparotomy incisions.
