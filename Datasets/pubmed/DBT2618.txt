Baby food exchanges and feeding the diabetic infant.
Because of the dangers of hypoglycemia to the developing brain, the need to develop a lifelong positive attitude toward an eating pattern, the inherent communication difficulties, and the spontaneity of the very young, the diabetic infant presents a particular challenge to medical personnel. Baby and toddler foods in jar measurements and formula have been translated into the American Diabetes Association exchanges to help in teaching families with diabetic infants the effects of various foods on the infant's diabetes. The exchanges are taught as tools in maintaining metabolic balance rather than as a fixed diet. Caloric level is planned on the basis of diet history and the infant's current growth status. Flexibility of pattern and attitude is emphasized to minimize conflict over eating and to allow normal spontaneous activity without jeopardizing health.
