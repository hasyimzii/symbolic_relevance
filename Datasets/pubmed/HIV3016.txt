Use of interleukin 2 in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
Twelve patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were treated with a natural product, highly purified human interleukin 2. Doses ranged from 250 to 250,000 units. No clinical responses were seen. Minimal toxicity was noted and consisted of mild prolongation of partial thromboplastin time and proteinuria. Immunologic changes during the study included a decrease in the number of circulating T8 lymphocytes, increased skin test reactivity, and a decline in serum immunoglobulin levels.
