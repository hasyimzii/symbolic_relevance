Time for HIV 1/HIV 2 combination tests?
We should like to report the case of an individual in the Middle East infected with HIV 2 whose serum was negative by our routine ELISA tests for HIV 1. We propose that screening for HIV 2, in addition to HIV 1, be performed on individuals who are clinically determined to be at risk for HIV infection. Commercially available HIV 1/HIV 2 combination tests may serve to identify both infectious agents.
