Needle sharing practices and risk for AIDS transmission among intravenous drug users in Seattle.
Sharing of needles by intravenous drug users is known to be one of the major means for the transmission of the HIV virus into the general population. In Seattle, where liberal laws make acquisition of needles relatively easy, it has been assumed that needle sharing is not a significant problem. Results of a survey of 212 methadone maintenance clients demonstrated that needle sharing is quite prevalent among intravenous drug users in this area and that addicts fail to sterilize their needles between uses. Because the rate of HIV infection among Seattle's intravenous drug users is relatively low, immediate intervention efforts by public health authorities can prevent a rapid acceleration of the infection rate.
