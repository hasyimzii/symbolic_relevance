Amputation of the lower leg with formation of a musculo cutaneous flap in vascular diseases.
A report is presented on leg amputations with formation of a posterior musculocutaneous flap, as used since 1970 at the authors' clinic for vascular diseases. A total of 87 patients were operated on. In 74.7%, the amputation stump healed per primam; in 88.7%, movements of the knee joint were completely preserved. Rehabilitative walking on the prosthesis is possible very soon after the operation. The described method of amputation may also be recommended for patients with extensive loss of circulation of the lower extremities, including cases complicated by diabetes.
