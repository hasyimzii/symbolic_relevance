The pattern of diabetic complications in African patients in Dar es Salaam.
The pattern of diabetic complications in African diabetics in Dar es Salaam was studied. In a series of 139 patients, 78 (71%) had at least one complication. The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy was 32%, retinopathy 25%, hypertension 26% and proteinuria 14%. Clinical or ECG findings compatible with ischaemic heart disease were present in 34% of patients, and in seven patients (6%) the ECG changes were classified as 'probably ischaemia'. The prevalence of complications showed no relationship to obesity, occupational group, smoking, sex or the quality of control. Most complications were positively related to age and to duration of the disease. In 83 of the patients, fasting serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured. Mean cholesterol concentrations were elevated in both sexes, but neither lipid was related to the prevalence of any complication.
