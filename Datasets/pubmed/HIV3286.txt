PolyI.polyC12U mediated inhibition of loss of alloantigen responsiveness viral replication in human CD4+ T cell clones exposed to human immunodeficiency virus in vitro.
Two alloreactive human CD4+ T cell clones, recognizing HLA DR2 and HLA DR1 determinants, lost their specific proliferative capacity after infection with HIV. This system was used to explore the effect of polyI.polyC12U on HIV replication and immune suppression. The mismatched double stranded RNA blocked HIV associated particulate reverse transcriptase activity and viral mediated cytopathic effects. Also, polyI.polyC12U preserved the alloreactivity of T cell clones after exposure to HIV.PolyI.polyC12U appeared to act at a level subsequent to host cell infection and reverse transcription. It had no effect on the enhancement of gene expression by the HIV transcription unit tatIII. These findings indicate that early in the course of infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes, HIV can directly abrogate proliferation to specific allodeterminants, and that this function is preserved in the presence of polyI.polyC12U. They also provide insight into the mechanism of antiviral action of a class of agent with potential clinical utility in AIDS.
