Elevated red blood cell/plasma choline ratio in dementia of the Alzheimer type: clinical and polysomnographic correlates.
In a prospective study we have observed a shift in distribution of red blood cell (RBC)/plasma choline ratios among patients with probable dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), compared with healthy controls and depressed patients. Fifteen of 22 DAT patients (68%) showed RBC/plasma choline ratios greater than 1.9, in contrast to 9 of 26 healthy controls (35%) and 7 of 20 depressives (35%). These significant differences confirm and expand earlier observations. The subgroup of DAT patients with elevated RBC/plasma choline ratios is older and more cognitively impaired, shows later onset of dementia, and has less rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than the DAT subgroup with normal RBC/plasma choline ratios. Within the entire group of DAT patients, moreover, the RBC/plasma choline ratio shows a significant inverse correlation with REM sleep latency. These findings are discussed in relation to abnormalities in other nonneural Alzheimer tissues and within the context of cholinergic involvement in both DAT and the timing of REM sleep.
