Accommodating change due to treatment in the method of back projection for estimating HIV infection incidence.
This note shows how the method of back projection, which is being widely applied  to predict the incidence of HIV infection, can be extended to incorporate distributional changes due to a treatment effect, such as zidovudine (commonly known as AZT). By way of example we consider one of the approaches to back projection and apply the method to some Australian data.
