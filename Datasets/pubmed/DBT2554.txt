The problem of the older primipara.
The obstetric data relating to 98 older primiparas (OP) (0.21% of all deliveries) are compared with 100 randomly chosen older multiparas (OM) and 100 young primiparas (YP). Notable differences observed were a higher incidence of toxemia and a greater incidence of uterine myomata in the OP group. No difference was seen in the incidences of diabetes, cardiac disease, and essential hypertension. There was a greater number of preterm deliveries. The frequencies of induction of labor, vacuum extraction, and cesarean section were much greater in the OP group. No difference in postnatal course was detected among the 3 groups. No significant increase in perinatal morbidity was observed, but the incidences of prematurity and perinatal mortality were higher. It seems that the attending obstetrician is much quicker to decide to terminate pregnancy or labor ithe OP group. Except for the need for special attention to prematurity and perinatal mortality, the OP group is not at high risk.
