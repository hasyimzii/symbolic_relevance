The worldwide AIDS epidemic and the role of Danida in the international control  work.
The global AIDS epidemic already influences health planning and distribution of resources to a great extent in the health sectors of many countries, particularly in the third world. AIDS will influence health development markedly among certain population groups in many of the countries with whom Danida works and the socio economical and demographic consequences of the epidemic influence planning of health assistance by Danida to a great extent. This article presents a brief review of the pattern of the global epidemic and a description of the present extent of the AIDS epidemic and tendency to develop. Some of the most important effects of the epidemic in Africa south of Sahara are described and it is documented that the individual countries affected by AIDS in Africa will experience very considerable direct and indirect expenses resulting from the epidemic. At the turn of the year 1989 1990, approximately 200,000 orphans of AIDS victims were present in Africa south of Sahara and this number will increase to approximately 500,000 by the end of 1992. This and other effects of the AIDS epidemic confront the individual countries with entirely new problems which require new and unorthodox strategies in health planning. Specific medical aspects of the HIV epidemic in developing countries are discussed together with the roles of WHO, Danida and the voluntary Danish organisations in global AIDS control. An obvious risk exists that a new programme for disease control which has access to relatively great resources will establish a new vertical structure both internationally and in the individual countries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
