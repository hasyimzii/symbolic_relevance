Successful methotrexate therapy in oral florid papillomatosis.
Oral florid papillomatosis is a rare syndrome, which was first described under this name by Rock & Fisher in 1960. The same syndrome had been previously described as papillomatosis mucosae oris carcinoides by Scheicher Gottron (1958). It is a benign condition, capable of malignant degeneration. Surgical excision and electrocoagulation are the most widely used therapeutic methods, despite the fact that relapse of symptoms after treatment by these methods is common. The literature comprises a few reports on favourable therapeutic effects obtained with small doses of methotrexate. This paper describes a patient with multifocal, very extensive form of oral florid papillomatosis, in whom both surgical excision and electrocoagulation were regarded as inadequate in view of the extensiveness of the lesion. Chemotherapy with methotrexate proved to be effective and resulted in complete remission. No relapse has occurred during a follow up period of over 2 years. The value of chemotherapy with methotrexate in the treatment of an extensive form of oral florid papillomatosis is emphasized.
