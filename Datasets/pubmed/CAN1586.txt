The diagnostic value of pharmacologic double contrast and conventional barium meal of the stomach (author's transl).
The authors compared the diagnostic accuracy of pharmacologic double contrast, conventional barium meal and oesophago gastro duodenoscopy of the stomach in 922 selected patients. The agreement rate between conventional investigation and endoscopy was 70.3%, while it was 83.7% between double contrast studies and endoscopy. Double contrast false positives percentage (48.7%) is bigger than that for conventional technique (38.3%), whilst the latter has a much bigger number of false negatives, both absolutely (169 cases) and relatively (61.7%). Furthermore the association of double contrast and endoscopy was compared with the anatomo pathological diagnosis in 335 cases. The agreement rate was 94.6%.
