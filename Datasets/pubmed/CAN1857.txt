Effect of a zinc deficient diet on the growth of an IgM secreting plasmacytoma (TEPC 183).
A diet deficient in zinc resulted in a significant decrease in the number of inbred BALB/c female mice developing transplantable plasmacytoma TEPC 183 compared to pair fed and ad libitum fed control mice. The size of the tumor relative to body weight was decreased in the zinc deficient group. Whereas the uptake of [3H]thymidine into tumor cells did not differ between the groups, the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into tumor cells was significantly reduced in the animals maintained on a zinc deficient diet.
