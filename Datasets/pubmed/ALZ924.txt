Chromatin proteins share antigenic determinants with neurofilaments.
Antigenic determinants common to distinct proteins may be unambiguously identified by the use of monoclonal antibodies. Some monoclonal antibodies to mammalian neurofilaments have recently been shown to cross react with the neurofibrillary tangles found at high density in the brains of senile dements with Alzheimers disease (SDAT). Here, we show that these antibodies also cross react with chromatin proteins, including the linker histones H1 and H1(0). Elevated levels of histone H1(0) have also been reported in SDAT brains.
