Growth hormone and metasomatotrophic diabetes: effects on insulin and proinsulin  of serum and pancreas in dogs.
In normal fasting dog serum, the insulin: proinsulin molar proportion was 71:29%. In response to glucose infusion, the proinsulin proportion decreased. In the pancreas, the proinsulin proportion was lower than in serum. Growth hormone treatment for one day increased serum insulin sevenfold and proinsulin 18 fold. The proinsulin proportion increased to 49%. The growth hormone injections magnified the response to glucose infusion. The rise in serum insulin was 16 times the normal, proinsulin also rose but its proportion decreased. Growth hormone treatment for 6 days decreased pancreatic insulin to 5% and proinsulin to 46% of normal. In the permanent (metasomatotrophic) diabetes produced by the prolonged administration of growth hormone, serum insulin decreased in the proinsulin proportion increased. No rises in serum insulin nor proinsulin occurred following glucose infusion. In the pancreas, insulin and proinsulin were reduced to 1.6% and 8% of normal. The reduction in the immunoreactive insulin in the pancreas was more pronounced in the tail than in the head and body regions. The results indicate that in the state of augmented insulin secretion and hyperinsulinaemia produced by growth hormone and in the reduced insulin secretion and hypoinsulinaemia of metasomatotrophic diabetes, the proportion of proinsulin in serum is increased due to beta cell secretion containing a higher proportion of proinsulin than normal
