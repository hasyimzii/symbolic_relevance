Sarcoma botryoides of the extrahepatic bile ducts. A light  and electron microscopic study of a case.
The clinical, light  and electron microscopic features of a sarcoma botryoides of the common bile duct of a 2 1/2 year old boy are reported. Despite the absence of cross striation under the light microscope, many tumour cells were found to contain abundant thin and thick filaments arranged in a sarcomere like pattern at the electron microscopic examination of originally paraffin embedded material. Ultrastructural examination of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma may be of value for a definite diagnosis also when only formalin fixed and paraffin embedded material is available.
