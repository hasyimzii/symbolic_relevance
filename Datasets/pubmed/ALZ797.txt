Superoxide dismutase isoenzymes in normal brains and in brains from patients with dementia of Alzheimer type.
CuZn superoxide dismutase and Mn superoxide dismutase were analysed in hypothalamus, nucleus caudatus, hippocampus and cortex gyrus cinguli from 14 patients with dementia of Alzheimer type and from 16 controls. Ample amounts of both enzymes were demonstrated in the brains and there was little difference between the various parts of the brain. There were only small differences in the enzymic activities between the two groups indicating that deficiencies of these enzymes are not a very likely cause of brain degeneration in dementias of Alzheimer type.
