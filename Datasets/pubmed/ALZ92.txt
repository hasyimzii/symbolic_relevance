Correlations between E.E.G. spectral and plasma prolactin levels in elderly subjects (author's transl).
Measurement of plasma prolactin levels in elderly subjects demonstrated the presence of a hyperprolactinemia with loss of normal circadian rhythm, regressing after bromocriptine treatment. The administration of bromocriptine to elderly subjects in a normal state of health provokes marked changes in the E.E.G. spectrum (slowing of delta activity, increase in alpha and decrease in beta rhythms). These findings show that there is an alteration in central dopaminergic systems during aging.
