Sleep in Pick disease.
19 polygraphic sleep recordings from 12 patients with Pick's Disease, including four histologically proved cases, were compared to those of an age matched control group. Symptoms had been present for a mean 8 years, the patients being aged 59 to 78 (mean 70.5 years). All sleep stages could be identified. Total sleep time was reduced and the number of awakenings was sharply increased. High proportion of stage 1 contrasted with the reduction in the other sleep stages with disappearance of stage 4 in advanced cases. REM Sleep was identified in all recordings, although reduced as a function of the length of the illness; its production as a function of total sleep time was not different from that of the control. REM Sleep appeared often fragmented and with a remarkably short latency, reminiscent of that observed in severely depressed patients.
