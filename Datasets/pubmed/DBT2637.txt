Emphysematous pyelonephritis in a solitary kidney.
Emphysematous pyelonephritis in a solitary kidney was present in a diabetic patient with servere electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycemia, oliguria and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of myocardial infarction. Percutaneous nephrostomy was performed as a life saving procedure and a week later a large matrix stone obstructing the renal pelvis was removed. The optimal therapy with a surgical or conservative approach is discussed. The use of percutaneous nephrostomy as an initial lifesaving procedure is suggested.
