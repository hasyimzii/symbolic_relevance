2' Azido 2',3' dideoxythymidine: synthesis and crystal structure of a 2' substituted dideoxynucleoside.
1 (2 Azido 2,3 dideoxy beta D erythro pentofuranosyl)thymine (2' N3ddThd) was synthesized from 1 (5 O trityl 2,3 anhydro beta D lyxofuranosyl)thymine by two different procedures. Method A prepared the title compound by opening of the oxirane ring with LiEt3BH followed by mesylation of the 2' hydroxyl function, introduction of the 2' azido substituent and deblocking of the 5' function. In method B nucleophilic opening of 3' deoxy 5' O (tert butyldimethylsilyl) 5 methyl 2,2' anhydrouridine+ ++ was carried out with sodium azide in hexamethylphosphoramide in the presence of benzoic acid. Single X ray crystallographic studies indicated a solid state conformation (3T2), which was opposite to that of the A form of AZT (2T3) but closely resembled that of 1 (2 fluoro 2,3 dideoxy beta D erythropentofuranosyl)thymine (2' FddThd) (3T2) and of 3' azido 2',3' dideoxy 2,6 diaminopurine riboside (3' N3ddDAP) (3T2). Whereas the latter displayed significant inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication, 2' FddThd and 2' N3ddThd were essentially inactive.
