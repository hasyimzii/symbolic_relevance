AZT in community practice.
AZT is the only available antiviral treatment. While using it, several problems appear to a general practitioner. 1) The supervision of the toxic effects, which is simple but does imply an experience. 2) The interaction of several drugs, while considering, among other difficulties, the great number of similar drugs available in pharmacies. 3) The psychological investment of the patient, for whom AZT is all at a time, a threat, a coercitive weapon and a hope. A proper knowledge of these problems allows the G.P. to work in agreement with the hospital practitioner.
