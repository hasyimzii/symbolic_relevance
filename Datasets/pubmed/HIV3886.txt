Influence of pregnancy on human immunodeficiency virus disease.
Over a period of 3 years (mean 16, extremes 3 and 36 months), we compared clinical and laboratory parameters of 128 female, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients, all in clinical stage II or III (CDC classification). 34 patients were pregnant and delivered a viable infant after at least 28 weeks of amenorrhea (group I), 29 patients were pregnant and had a spontaneous or induced abortion during the first or second trimester (group II), and 64 were non pregnant female control patients (group III). The changes in the clinical stages over time were not statistically significant between the groups. The only laboratory parameters that were significantly higher in group I at the time of the delivery were: leucocyte count (p less than 0.001), lymphocyte count (p less than 0.05), and sedimentation rate (p less than 0.001). These changes are known to be related to pregnancy and not to HIV disease. All other laboratory parameters showed no significant differences within and between the groups. We conclude, that pregnancy  carried to term or interrupted  does not aggravate the natural evolution of HIV infection in clinical stage II and III patients.
