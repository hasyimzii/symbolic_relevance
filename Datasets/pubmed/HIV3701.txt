Zidovudine. The current status of its evaluation.
3' azido 3' deoxythymidine is a thymidine analogue with an in vitro as well as in vivo efficacy towards HIV mediated infection. Zidovudine exerts its action, following an intracellular three step phosphorylation, through viral reverse transcriptase inhibition. Its half life is approximately one hour. Oral biodisponibility is 65%, and passage through blood brain barrier results in therapeutic levels is CSF. Clinical evaluation has enabled demonstration of a beneficial effect on survival of stage IV AIDS patients, when treated after a PCP episode. In this setting, aggregate survival ratios reach 73% after one year of follow up, and 41% after 2 years. In addition, zidovudine activity has been demonstrated in treatment of HIV induced thrombopenias as well as HIV related central nervous system disorders. Presently, zidovudine therapeutic evaluation proceeds through the following main axes: dosage tuning (either by lowering of standard dose, and/or dose interval modification); combination with other antiviral therapies; lastly, patient treatment et an early stage of disease.
