Neuropeptides in Alzheimer's disease, depression and schizophrenia. A post mortem analysis of vasoactive intestinal peptide and cholecystokinin in cerebral cortex.
Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and cholecystokinin (CCK) have been measured, by radioimmunoassay, in cerebral cortex obtained at autopsy from patients without neurological or psychiatric disease and from patients with Alzheimer's disease, depression and schizophrenia. Sephadex gel filtration indicated that over 90% of the CCK immunoreactivity was associated with the octapeptide in extracted material from the different clinical groups investigated. There were no significant differences from the normal in the overall concentrations of either VIP or CCK in any of the psychiatric groups examined, although differences in Alzheimer's disease were apparent when cases were grouped according to postmortem delay.
