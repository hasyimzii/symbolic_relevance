Follow up computer tomography in patients with carcinoma of the rectum (author's transl).
Conventional X ray examination, ultrasonography, and skeletal scintigraphy are insufficient diagnostic procedures in the follow up of many cases after surgery of rectum carcinoma, since they do not allow early diagnosis of local relapses. A report is given, which shows, that in these cases computer tomography may help in diagnosis. Recurrent tumors of 1.5 2 cm diameter may be diagnosed by computer tomography with sufficient reliability; at the same time peritumorous tissue can be looked at and infiltrative growth as well as regional lymph node enlargement may be diagnosed. This will help the surgeon to decide about a second surgical intervention, or it may help the radiologist in localizing and estimating the volume of tumor relapse, which can be of value for X ray therapy. Thus computer tomography does have its place without doubt in the follow up of patients after resection of the rectum.
