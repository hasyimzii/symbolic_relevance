The nature and action of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factors.
Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM CSF) stimulates the in vitro proliferation and differentiation of granulocytic and macrophage cells. This regulator is now known to act at other levels of hemopoietic regulation. The heterogeneity of GM CSFs is not only related to the tissue of origin and the in vitro production method, but also to functional subclasses of the molecule that have distinct biologic specificities. Most adult mouse organs produce GM CSF (mol wt 23,000), but a macrophage (M) CSF has been detected in fetal conditioned medium (CM) and isolated from L cell CM. Murine endotoxin serum appears to contain a M CSF, GM CSF, and G CSF, the last of which cofractionates with a differentiation factor active on leukemic cells. Human GM CSFs, G CSF, and EO CSFs active on human cells have been detected in a variety of CM, but as yet none have been purified. Again, there are subclasses of progenitor cells that respond to particular forms of human active CSFs. GM CSF isolated from mouse lung CM stimulates multipotential progenitor cells, the initial proliferatin of progenitors in the erythroid, eosinophil, and megakaryocyte series, as well as mature cells in the GM series. While GM CSF is also able to stimulate the differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells, other factors appear to be more potent in this respect. Information on the regulation of GM CSF production, on the modulators of its action on specific target cells, and on its role in vivo will be required before the physiologic function of this molecule can be properly assessed.
