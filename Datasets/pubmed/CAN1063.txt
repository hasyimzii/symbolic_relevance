Estrogen receptor status and response to chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer:  the Tufts Shattuck Pondville experience.
Eighty eight patients with advanced breast cancer were retrospectively reviewed to compare estrogen receptor (ER) data with response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. All assays were done in a single laboratory. All patients were cared for at a single institution. Thirty four patients were treated with chemotherapy, 30 of whom were evaluable for response by criteria of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Of 16 ER positive patients, 12 (75%) responded; of 14 ER negative patients, six (43%) responded (P < 0.05). The two groups did not differ significantly in chemotherapy received, menopausal status, site of predominant disease, stage at diagnosis, or disease free interval. Response to cytotoxic chemotherapy does not appear to correlate with ER status.
