Down modulation of HIV 1 gene expression using a procaryotic RNA binding protein.
The coat protein of the single stranded RNA bacteriophages acts as a translational repressor by binding with high affinity to a target RNA that encompasses the ribosomal binding site of the replicase gene. We have expressed this procaryotic RNA binding protein in mammalian cells. Using the coat protein binding site attached to the HIV 1 5' leader RNA, we tested for the biological effect of co expressed bacteriophage protein. We found that HIV 1 LTR directed expression within this context was inhibited in trans by the coat protein. This example suggests the feasibility of using procaryotic RNA binding proteins as genetic modulators in eucaryotic cells.
