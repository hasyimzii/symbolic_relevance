A protocol for outpatient management of asymptomatic human immunodeficiency infection.
The epidemic of HIV infection and its consequences are being increasingly encountered by primary care community physicians. The management of these patients is especially challenging. Presented here is a protocol that utilizes a flow chart for laboratory and treatment decisions and a checklist highlighting signs and symptoms to look for in regular office visits of HIV patients. Matters of legality, physicians' responsibility, insurance, lifestyle management, and prevention of opportunistic infections are discussed. The use of zidovudine (AZT) and alternative drugs is reviewed. More understanding of the special needs of HIV patients will enable the primary care physician to better serve the future needs of his community.
