Failure of low doses of 131I to ablate residual thyroid tissue following surgery  for thyroid cancer.
Thirteen patients received an initial dose of 25 29.9 mCi (9259 1, 106 MB1) of 131I following partial thyroidectomy for papillary, follicular, or mixed carcinoma. Administration of thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3) was stopped 3 12 weeks and 1 6 weeks, respectively, before therapy or imaging. Patients remained on normal diets and did not receive thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or diuretics. Follow up 3 months to 2 years after therapy demonstrated that ablation of thyroid bed activity was successful in only one patient, who still had metastases. This suggests that administration of 25 29.9 mCi of 131I following surgery is unreliable for ablation of residual thyroid bed activity.
