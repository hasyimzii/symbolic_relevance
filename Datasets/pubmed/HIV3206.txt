In vitro modification of human immunodeficiency virus infection by granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and gamma interferon.
The ability of recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM CSF) and gamma interferon (IFN gamma) to modify human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; also called HTLV III/LAV) infection in the monocytic cell line U 937 was examined. When added to persistently infected cell cultures, GM CSF at 30 300 units per ml produced maximal reductions in reverse transcriptase activity of 37 55% 10 14 days after its addition, whereas IFN gamma produced reductions of 64 68% 10 17 days after addition. When used prior to acute HIV infection and maintained in the cell culture system, these cytokines reduced reverse transcriptase activity 90 100% and nearly eliminated viral antigen expression but did not prevent return of productive infection after their removal. These results indicate that, in a monocyte model of HIV infection, GM CSF and IFN gamma substantially restrict HIV expression and that these cytokines deserve further evaluation as therapeutic alternatives in HIV related disorders.
