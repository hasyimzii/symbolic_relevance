Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in HIV infection: therapeutic possibilities of intravenous immunoglobulins.
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is often present in HIV infections and may occur at any stage with frequently severe hemorrhagic risks. In order to evaluate the possible beneficial therapeutic effects of intravenous immunoglobulins at doses of 1 g/Kg/day, the author compared two groups of 10 HIV positive patients each, with severe thrombocytopenia treated with randomized therapy. The different results obtained in the two groups were significant both for the restoration and the maintenance of the platelet count and therefore for the duration of the hemorrhagic disorders.
