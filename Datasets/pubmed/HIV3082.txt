Sarcoidosis is not associated with the HTLV III virus.
Superficial immunological similarities between sarcoidosis and AIDS led to this radioimmunoassay survey of serum antibodies to HTLV III virus in 17 patients with active sarcoidosis, 8 with peripheral lymphadenopathy. Serum antibodies were negative in all patients with sarcoidosis.
