Papillary elastofibroma of the left ventricular septum.
Papillary elastofibromas of the heart are usually incidental findings at autopsy. They occur more commonly on the surfaces of the valves than on the mural endothelium and are characterized by a papillary configuration with fronds composed of a collagenous and elastic tissue core lined by hyperplastic endothelial cells. Echocardiography and cardiac catherization demonstrated the lesion preoperatively in this case.
