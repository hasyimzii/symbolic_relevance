Urothelial carcinoma of the kidney and ureter.
Two hundred and three patients with upper tract urothelial tumours were reviewed. Eighty had pelvicaliceal tumours, 90 ureteric tumours, and 33 multifocal tumours of both pelvis and ureter. Two hundred patients had transitional cell carcinomas and 3 had squamous cell carcinomas. The overall corrected 5 year and 10 year survival rates were 59.7% and 41.1% respectively. Widespread multifocal occurrence poor differentiation, penetration of the muscle coat and conservative resection of tumours predisposed to a poorer prognosis.
