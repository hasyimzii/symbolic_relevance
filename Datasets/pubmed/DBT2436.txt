The significance of pancreatic islet cell antibody and abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy.
Five out of 50 pregnant subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (a 2 hr venous plasma glucose concentration over 6.6 mmol/1) had cytoplasmic islet cell antibody (ICAb cyto) in their sera. Three of these 5 developed unequivocal insulin dependent diabetes in the first year following pregnancy, while none of the others did so. When taken in conjunction with the presence of islet cell antibody, the severity of impairment of glucose tolerance during pregnancy (but not obesity) was an additional indicator of the likelihood of developing insulin dependent diabetes during the first postpartum year.
