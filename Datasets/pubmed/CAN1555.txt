Reduction in the transplacental carcinogenic effect of methylcholanthrene in mice by prior treatment with beta naphthoflavone.
Conversion of 14C benzo[alpha]pyrene (BP) to alkali soluble and water phase products, as a measure of aryl hydrocarbon metabolism, was assayed on day 18 of gestation in the livers of pregnant C57BL/6 females and their (C57BL/6 x BALB/c)F1 fetuses. BP metabolism was inducible in both maternal and fetal livers by beta naphthoflavone (beta NF), injected ip on day 16 of gestation at doses of 25 130 mg/kg. At 25 and 75 mg/kg beta NF, fetal liver metabolism of BP was induced 1.5  and 4.5 fold, respectively. The corresponding results for maternal liver indicated no effect at 25 mg/kg and 2.6 fold induction at 75 mg/kg. In a complementary carcinogenesis assay, pregnant mothers were injected ip with beta NF (25 or 75 mg/kg) on day 15 of gestation and 3 methylcholanthrene (MC) (30 or 150 mg/kg) on day 17. Appropriate vehicle injected control mice were also obtained. The progeny were examined for lung tumors at 28 weeks of age. The average number of lung tumors per mouse caused by 150 mg/kg MC was significantly reduced by prior treatment with beta NF, to an extent depending on the dose of the inducer. With the 75 mg/kg dose of beta NF, the incidence of lung tumors was reduced by half. Induction of carcinogen detoxification in maternal, fetal, and/or placental tissue is a possible mechanism by which beta NF protected against transplacental MC tumorigenesis.
