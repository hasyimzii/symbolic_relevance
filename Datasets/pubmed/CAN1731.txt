Colorectal cancer: the modern treatment of disseminated disease   a review.
Most patients who develop cancer of the large bowel will eventually develop recurrence and will therefore be considered for treatment of that recurrence. There exists very great confusion as to the efficacy of the various treatment options available. This review has attempted to evaluate critically the claim for therapeutic efficacy of the various treatment options, with particular regard to patients with liver metastases from primary tumours of the large bowel. A case can be made out for surgical removal of recurrent or disseminated colorectal cancer, but there is no evidence that any form of treatment other than total surgical excision will result in prolonged patient survival. All forms of treatment can be effective in palliating symptomatic patients. Therefore, with the exception of total surgical excision of recurrent tumour, treatment should be reserved for those patients with symptoms, and the choice of treatment offered should be weighed against possible side effects.
