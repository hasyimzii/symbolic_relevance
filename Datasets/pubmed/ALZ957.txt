Computed tomographic density numbers. A comparative study of patients with senile dementia and normal elderly controls.
Cranial computed tomography (CT) scans of 48 patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) and 40 normal elderly volunteers were compared. The demented group were found to have significantly larger lateral ventricles assessed planimetrically and by using a linear measure of the ratio of the maximum width of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles to the maximum intracranial diameter. Attenuation density was computed for 15 brain regions. The demented group did not differ significantly from the normal controls with respect to attenuation density in any of the regions studied.
