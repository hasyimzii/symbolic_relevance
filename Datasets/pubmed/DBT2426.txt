Traumatic chiasmal syndrome.
We studied 11 patients with the uncommon finding of traumatic chiasmal syndrome after closed head trauma. Visual field defects varied from complete monocular blindness and contralateral temporal hemianopia to subtle bitemporal arcuate scotomas. The degree of visual loss was not necessarily related to the severity of the craniocerebral trauma. Diabetes insipidus was present in half of these patients, but unlike the visual abnormalities, this complication was transient.
