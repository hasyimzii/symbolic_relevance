Mutagenesis and morphological transformation of mammalian cells by a non bay region polycyclic cyclopenta(cd)pyrene and its 3,4 oxide.
Cyclopenta(cd)pyrene, a constituent of environmental emissions, has been found to mutate and transform mammalian cells in culture. Cyclopenta(cd)pyrene 3,4 oxide, a presumed metabolite, was found to be a direct acting mutagen and to transform mammalian cells. These results suggest that cyclopenta(cd)pyrene 3,4 oxide may be an ultimate mutagenic form of the parent hydrocarbon.
