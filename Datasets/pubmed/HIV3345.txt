CBF tomograms with 99mTc HM PAO in patients with dementia (Alzheimer type and HIV) and Parkinson's disease  initial results.
We present preliminary data on the utility of functional brain imaging with [99mTc] d,l HM PAO and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the study of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), HIV related dementia syndrome, and the "on off" syndrome of Parkinson's disease. In comparison with a group of age matched controls, the DAT patients revealed distinctive bilateral temporal and posterior parietal deficits, which correlate with detailed psychometric evaluation. Patients with amnesia as the main symptom (group A) showed bilateral mesial temporal lobe perfusion deficits (p less than 0.02). More severely affected patients (group B) with significant apraxia, aphasia, or agnosia exhibited patterns compatible with bilateral reduced perfusion in the posterior parietal cortex, as well as reduced perfusion to both temporal lobes, different from the patients of the control group (p less than 0.05). SPECT studies of HIV patients with no evidence of intracraneal space occupying pathology showed marked perfusion deficits. Patients with Parkinson's disease and the "on off" syndrome studied during an "on" phase (under levodopa therapy) and on another occasion after withdrawal of levodopa ("off") demonstrated a significant change in the uptake of [99mTc] d,l HM PAO in the caudate nucleus (lower on "off") and thalamus (higher on "off"). These findings justify the present interest in the functional evaluation of the brain of patients with dementia. [99mTc] d,l HM PAO and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)/SPECT appear useful and highlight individual disorders of flow in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions.
