Age related glucose metabolism alterations in nondiabetic and potentially diabetic women.
The incidence of pathological glucose tolerance was investigated in women of three age groups: 20  39, 40  59 and over 60 yr, by means of oral glucose tolerance tests and the Danowski Index. The incidence was found to be significantly higher in older women: thus an age related deterioration of glucose metabolism was confirmed. The women in each are group were further divided into "healthy" nondiabetic and "potentially diabetic" women. The parameter of "potential diabetes" was found to be associated to a greater extent with age related glucose tolerance deterioration than advancing age alone. The existing theories for the etiology of carbohydrate metabolism alteration in older women are reviewed. it is suggested that in view of the age related deterioration of glucose metabolism, a new normal range of glucose tolerance should be established in an ageing population.
