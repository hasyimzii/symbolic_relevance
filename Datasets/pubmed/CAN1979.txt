No apparent nucleotide sequence specificity in cellular DNA juxtaposed to retrovirus proviruses.
The sequences of the virus cell junctions of seven DNA clones of spleen necrosis  virus provirus were analyzed to determine the nucleotide sequence specificity of the cellular integration sites. As previously reported for one provirus, all clones contain a 5 base pair direct repeat of cellular DNA at the cell virus junctions and a 3 base pair inverted repeat at both ends of the provirus DNA. The sequences of the 5 base pair direct repeats are different in each clone and have no apparent homology to viral DNA. No apparent common features and no sequences significantly homologous to the ends of the provirus DNA were found in the cellular DNAs surrounding the viral integration sites.
