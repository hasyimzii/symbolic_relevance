Reactivation of serum creatine kinase isoenzyme BB in patients with malignancies.
Reactivation of serum creatine kinase isoenzyme BB (CK BB) with 2 mercaptoethanol and EDTA increased the electrophoretic detection rate of CK BB from 34% to 78% in 58 hospitalized patients with various malignancies. Patients with solid tumors showed the largest and patients with hematologic malignancies the smallest percentage increase in CK BB after reactivation. For serum from 50 hospitalized patients without cancer, reactivation resulted in detectable CK BB in two patients; the CK BB band was never seen in 15 healthy adults. For reasons unknown, five of eight patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type showed CK BB in serum after reactivation, as did two of five patients suspected of having this disorder. Serum CK BB may be a useful tumor marker if reactivation with a thiol and EDTA is used immediately after collection.
