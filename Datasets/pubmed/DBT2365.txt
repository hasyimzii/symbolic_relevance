Studies on retinal neovascularization. Friedenwald Lecture.
Evidence supporting the original concept of Michaelson and Ashton of a vasoproliferative or angiogenesis factor responsible for retinal neovascularization is discussed. The oxygen model of retinal neovascularization is described as a key example in this evidence. Newer studies on experimental retinal neovascularization and its control are summarized.
