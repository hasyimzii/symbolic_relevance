Challenge of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) immunized with human immunodeficiency  virus envelope glycoprotein gp120.
The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1), the causative agent of acquired  immunodeficiency syndrome, infects humans and chimpanzees. To determine the efficacy of immunization for preventing infection, chimpanzees were immunized with gp120 purified from human T cell lymphotrophic virus type IIIB (HTLV IIIB) infected cell membranes and challenged with the homologous virus, HTLV IIIB. A challenge stock of HTLV IIIB was prepared by using unconcentrated HTLV IIIB produced in H9 cells. The titer of the virus from this stock on human and chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in human lymphoid cell lines was determined; a cell culture infectivity of 10(4) was assigned. All chimpanzees inoculated intravenously with 40 cell culture infectious units or more became infected, as demonstrated by virus isolation and seroconversion. One of two chimpanzees inoculated with 4 cell culture infectious units became infected. Chimpanzees immunized with gp120 formulated in alum developed antibodies which precipitated gp120 and neutralized HTLV IIIB. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from gp120 vaccinated and HIV infected animals showed a significantly greater response in proliferation assays with HIV proteins than did peripheral blood mononuclear cells from nonvaccinated and non HIV infected chimpanzees. Two of the gp120 alum immunized chimpanzees were challenged with virus from the HTLV IIIB stock. One animal received 400 cell culture infectious units, and one received 40 infectious units. Both animals became infected with HIV, indicating that the immune response elicited by immunization with gp120 formulated in alum was not effective in preventing infection with HIV 1.
