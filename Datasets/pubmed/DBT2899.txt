Testicular biopsies in male diabetics.
Histological exazerbations in 17 diabetics who underwent a biopsy of the testicles and 6 control persons with healthy metabolism could increasedly prove findings deviating from the normal in male diabetics. Disturbances of the germinal epithelium of slight to middle degree are in the foreground, which must not be overvaluated in their effect on fertility. In the relatively frequent childlessness in the marriages of diabetic males disturbances of the potentia coeundi apparently play an important role.
