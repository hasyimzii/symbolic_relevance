Loss of endoplasmic reticulum associated enzymes in affected brain regions in Huntington's disease and Alzheimer type dementia.
Post mortem brain samples from patients with either Huntington's disease, Alzheimer type dementia or appropriate controls were assayed for endoplasmic reticulum enzymes, NADPH cytochrome c reductase, neutral alpha glucosidase, inosine diphosphatase, alpha mannosidase and glucose 6 phosphatase and for Golgi enzymes, fucosyl  and galactosyl transferases. In Alzheimer type dementia there was a selective decrease in alpha glucosidase activity in the temporal cortex. In Huntington's disease there was a selective decrease of putamen alpha glucosidase and fucosyl transferase activities. It is suggested that these changes reflect highly specific alterations in glycoprotein synthesis and processing and may contribute to the underlying pathology of these disorders.
