Secretion of neurotoxins by mononuclear phagocytes infected with HIV 1.
Mononuclear phagocytes (microglia, macrophages, and macrophage like giant cells)  are the principal cellular targets for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) in the central nervous system (CNS). Since HIV 1 does not directly infect neurons, the causes for CNS dysfunction in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) remain uncertain. HIV 1 infected human monocytoid cells, but not infected human lymphoid cells, released toxic agents that destroy chick and rat neurons in culture. These neurotoxins were small, heat stable, protease resistant molecules that act by way of N methyl D aspartate receptors. Macrophages and microglia infected with HIV 1 may produce neurologic disease through chronic secretion of neurotoxic factors.
