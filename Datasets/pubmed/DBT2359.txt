Management of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the uterine cervix (cylindroma): report of six cases and reappraisal of all cases reported in the medical literature.
We report 6 new cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma (cylindroma) of the uterine cervix (5, invasive cancer and 1, in situ cancer). All 6 patients were elderly women and 5 were hypertensive. Additionally, 3 (Patients 1, 2, and 4) were obese and 1 (Patient 3) had diabetes mellitus. Three patients were seen because of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding and 3 were found to have malignant cells on routine exfoliative cytologic examination. Histologically, the tumor cells were relatively uniform, with scanty cytoplasms and a palisading pattern at the periphery of the tumor masses. Round cystic spaces were found in all 6 cases and hyaline nodules were present in some of the cyclic spaces in 2. The tumors were found in Stages IA, IB, IIB, IIB, and IIIB (cases 1 4 and 6 respectively), and were treated with irradiation only. There have been only 38 cases of invasive adenoid cystic carcinoma of the cervix reported in the world medical literature. We review the treatment and survival for all 38 cases previously reported and add 5 new cases.
