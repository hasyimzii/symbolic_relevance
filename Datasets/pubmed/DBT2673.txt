Serum lipids and apoprotein composition (%) of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) fraction in two groups of diabetic patients: effects of oral as compared to insulin therapy.
Forty one diabetic patients (21 males and 20 females) were divided into two groups according to treatment. One group (n = 22) was treated with insulin and the other with oral therapy (tolbutamide) (n = 19). The two groups of patients were in a good metabolic control in that the glucose loss in the urine was less than 10 g/24 h. In these two groups we have evaluated total serum cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), VLDL TC/TG ratio and prevalence of 'double pre beta lipoproteinemia'. For these parameters no significant differences have been found between the two groups. The results of our study suggest that, provided metabolic control is good, the VLDL metabolism does not seem to be affected by the type of treatment.
