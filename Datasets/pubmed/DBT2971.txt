Nursing management of diabetes insipidus.
Diabetes insipidus is seen most frequently in neurosurgical patients. The transient form is more common and usually subsides prior to discharge. Permanent DI is seen in patients with extensive damage in the hypothalamic area. Treatment of either form of DI is usually with a preparation of vasopressin. Nursing assessements and interventions are crucial to a successful outcome in patients with this disorder. Health teaching for patients with permanent DI is an integral part of the nursing responsibility.
