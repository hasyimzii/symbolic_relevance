Nominal dysphasia and the severity of senile dementia.
Previous research has shown that nominal dysphasia occurs commonly as a language  disorder in senile dementia (Alzheimers' type). This study provides evidence that the degree of nominal dysphasia shown by a patient may be a reliable index of the severity of dementia, as measured by both behavioural and cognitive rating scales.
