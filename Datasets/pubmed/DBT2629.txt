Diagnosis of retinal vascular changes in diabetic children by means of fluorescein angiography (author's transl).
By means of fluorescein angiography diabetic microangiopathy can be earlier revealed than by means of ophthalmoscopy. 36 children with diabetes (aged 6,25 15,5 years, x 11,6 years) with a duration of the diabetes between 0 and 12,75 years (x 3,9) were submitted to fluorescein   angiography, in 20 cases a follow up study was performed. Pathological changes were found in 21 cases, in 10 of 15 children with normal angiograms the duration of the disease was less than 5 years. More than 50% of all patients followed up showed an increase of diabetic microangiopathy.
