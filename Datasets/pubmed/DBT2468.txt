The effect of glibenclamide on the glucose and insulin profile in maturity onset  diabetics following both acute and long term treatment.
Glibenclamide was administered to five non insulin dependent diabetic (NIDD) patients, whose hyperglycaemia was not controlled by diet alone. The plasma glucose and insulin porfile was determined under strictly standardised conditions before, after the first administration and after 6 months of treatment with glibenclamide. A rapid and satisfactory lowering of plasma glucose was observed in all patients after the first administered dose and a very similar response was seen after 6 months of therapy, when glibenclamide was administered once a day. Despite a consistent plasma glucose lowering effect a very variable plasma insulin response was evident between the patients. This difference may be of relevance in the long term prognosis of these patients with respect to atherogenesis. For the period of the study weight gain was minimal, no episodes of hypoglycaemia or alcohol induced flushing were recorded.
