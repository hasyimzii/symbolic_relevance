Ribavirin suppresses replication of lymphadenopathy associated virus in cultures of human adult T lymphocytes.
The in vitro effect of ribavirin on the replication of lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV), one of the prototype viruses aetiologically associated with lymphadenopathy syndrome and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, was tested. Ribavirin, a nucleoside, suppressed the replication of LAV in cultures of human adult T lymphocytes. Suppression occurred at ribavirin concentrations of 50 micrograms/ml or higher.
