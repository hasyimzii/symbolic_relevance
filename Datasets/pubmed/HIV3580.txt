Disparate effects of two herpesvirus corrected immediate early gene trans activators on the HIV 1 LTR.
The BMLF1 region of the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) genome and the immediate early (IE) region of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) both encode proteins which can trans activate heterologous promoter/chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) constructs, including a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter/CAT construct. We demonstrate here that this trans activation by the EBV BMLF1 gene product, which we have previously shown to be largely post transcriptional, is reporter gene dependent. In contrast, trans activation by the HCMV IE gene product(s), previously shown to be mediated at the RNA level, is seen regardless of whether CAT, human growth hormone, or beta galactosidase is used as the reporter gene. Mutational analysis revealed no specific cis acting sequences within the HIV 1 promoter which were required for trans activation by the HCMV IE gene product(s).
