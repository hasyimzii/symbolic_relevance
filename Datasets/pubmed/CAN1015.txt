Karyologic analysis in erythroleukemia.
We report the cytogenetic data of two patients with erythroleukemia showing the chromosome Ph'. In one case the chromosome Ph', as revealed with the GTG band technique was the result of a translocation involving the chromosomes 19 and 22. The aim of this work is to provide more contribution to the knowledge of the origin of the Ph' and to give data in the field of this disease for which few cytogenetic data are available after the introduction of the banding techniques.
