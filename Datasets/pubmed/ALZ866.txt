Hyperammonemia in Alzheimer's disease.
Postprandial blood ammonia levels were significantly higher in 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease than in 37 control subjects. In the Alzheimer group, fasting blood ammonia levels were significantly higher in patients whose EEGs showed triphasic waves than in patients without this change. The direction of change from fasting to postprandial blood ammonia levels was also significantly different between these two groups.
