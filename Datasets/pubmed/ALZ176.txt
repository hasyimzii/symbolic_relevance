Classic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia.
Documented cases of classic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) combined with severe dementia are few and come from the isolated populations of the Western Pacific. In this report, three women had a clinically and neuropathologically documented combination of ALS and dementia. In all cases the symptoms and signs of ALS were mainly bulbar. In two of them dementia appeared first, followed by ALS. At autopsy, there was a marked discrepancy between the severe degree of dementia of Alzheimer's type and the sight nonspecific neuropathologic findings without Alzheimer's changes. Our cases bear a close resemblance to recently published Japanese cases. It may be concluded that the combination of sporadic ALS and progressive dementia seems to be a clinical entity without consistent neuropathologic changes and that it also occurs in the western countries.
