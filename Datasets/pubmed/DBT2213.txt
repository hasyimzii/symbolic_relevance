Contractile and relaxing activity of arterial smooth muscle from streptozotocin diabetic rats.
Contractures induced by 10( 4)M phenylephrine (PE) and 70 mM KCl and their relaxation by 10( 2) M theophylline (theo) were observed in aortae isolated from untreated and insulin treated streptozotocin diabetic rats for 12 weeks after the induction of diabetes. Diabetes consistently caused an average decrease of 40% in the PE and K contractures. Treatment of diabetic animals with 2.0 3.5 units (U) of Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin/day/partially prevented diabetes induced decreases in the PE contractures while completely preventing them in the K contractures. Relaxation of the PE contracture, which was more susceptible to theo than was the K contracture in control tissues, was not affected by either untreated or insulin treated diabetes until 12 weeks after the induction of diabetes. While in vivo insulin treatment did not reverse diabetes induced decreases in the theo induced relaxation of the PE contracture, it did prevent the diabetes induced increase in the relaxation of the K contracture which was observed after 4 weeks. The results indicate that while the mechanisms involved in mediating the PE and K contractures are inhibited by diabetes, insulin is more effective at preventing the effects of diabetes on the K contracture and its relaxation than on the induction and relaxation of the PE contracture.
