Polymorphic trophonosis: the pseudo omnivorous diet related disease  a hypothesis.
Consideration of a wide range of seemingly disparate, non infectious diseases reveals that most of them are only the varying forms or symptoms of a single, diet related disease postulated to be Polymorphic Trophonosis. It is pointed out that they are all associated with pseudo omnivorous dietary practices  negating the biological limitations of Homo omnivorus. In these practices, neither the out of all proportion consumption of certain essential nutrients nor the liberal eating of new types of food seems to be suitable to the structure and mode of functioning of the digestive and/or metabolic systems.
