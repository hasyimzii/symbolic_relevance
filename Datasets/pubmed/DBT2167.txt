Arteriosclerosis obliterans and associated risk factors in insulin dependent and  non insulin dependent diabetes.
The prevalence of arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) of the legs was determined by a battery of noninvasive tests in 141 insulin dependent and 289 non insulin dependent diabetic subjects and in 64 other subjects. The prevalence of detectable ASO ranges from 18% in the younger IDDM group to 41% in the diet treated NIDDM group. The prevalence of ASO increases 7.5% per decade, appears to increase 6.5% in the age adjusted IDDM group, 9% in males, 19% in those with hypertension, and 12% in smokers. No consistently significant correlations with fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, or obesity were found. After accounting for the effect of smoking, the increased risk for ASO in males becomes nonsignificant.
