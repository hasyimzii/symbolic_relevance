Computed tomography diagnosis of renal angiomyolipoma.
Six computed tomography examinations were performed on four patients: two of them had tuberous sclerosis, and the other two had solitary angiomyolipomas. Computed tomography is an easy way of diagnosing tumoral hemorrhages and thus facilitates the supervision of patients with tuberous sclerosis. In two patients, the authors observed dense masses that might have indicated cartilage deposits.
