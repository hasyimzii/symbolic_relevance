Early detection of recurrent uterine cervical cancers (author's transl).
In the treatise the authors aimed to find some early signs of aggravation on the  treated uterine cervical cancers by routine clinical methods. Initially nine autopsy materials died of cancer were studied to survey the anatomical spreading and each documented. Then their ante mortem findings were summarized to review. Secondarily chief complains and clinical manifestations collected above were investigated among twenty one patients who were clearly attacked and/or died of recurrence. As a control thirteen patients free from the disease were encountered. Progressive pain associated with edema either in ipsilateral low back, limbs or lower abdomen was one of the most suspicious signs of intra pelvic recurrence. Palpable noduli and thickening of parametrial areas and pelvic walls were as well a sign of exacerbation, if they appeared after treatments. Repeating urinary infection and aggravating hydro nephrosis et ureter frequently implied an insidious sign of pelvic recurrence. Continuing obstinate cough may be suggestive for pulmonary metastasis and needs chest roentgenogram. Increased serum alkaline phosphatase, LDH and ESR, and decreased peripheral lymphocyte count were frequently observed in the recurrent group. A suspicious or positive vaginal cytology was mostly indicative for pathological examination that would give us a final validity. Biopsy was done for superficial enlargements.
