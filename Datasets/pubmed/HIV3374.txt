Human immunodeficiency virus antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid.
The relative concentrations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies in relation to equal IgG contents of 46 serum cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 32 patients were determined by serial dilution in an anti HIV enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ratio of CSF and the serum HIV antibody concentration was expressed as QHIV = CSF dilution/serum dilution. QHIV is regarded as a parameter for specific intrathecal HIV antibody production. The QHIV ranged from 0.7 to 16. Six of seven patients with clinical signs of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related dementia (ARD), but only seven of 25 patients without clinical diagnosis of ARD showed a QHIV greater than 2.
