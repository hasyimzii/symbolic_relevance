Probability in the clinical diagnoses of Pick disease and Alzheimer disease.
This paper is dedicated to the honour of Prof. Dr. Erich Sternberg. The diagnostical strategy of well known specialists for the Morbus Pick and Morbus Alzheimer is considered. As a result of our own experiences and analyses the psychopathological factors are assigned to the following groups: change of vitality; change of personality; reversible organic psychoses; fuzzy brain local symptoms; development of dementia. For these groups growth curves are given for which the analytic description by a special type of a differential equation, is used. The different behaviour of the development of the dementia to the Morbus Pick and Morbus Alzheimer is found.
