Senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT): reduced T8+ cell mediated suppressor  activity.
We compared patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT) and age matched controls with respect to T8+ cell mediated suppressor function using a pokeweed mitogen (pwm) induced IgG secretion assay. The responding B cells were allogeneic to the T regulator cells. T8+ cell mediated suppression was lower in SDAT patients than the controls when we used either 2 X 10(4) or 5 X 10(4) T8+ cells. Suppressor function was lower in both SDAT and elderly controls than in young adults. SDAT patients and controls did not differ with regard to T4+ cell mediated helper activity. In SDAT patients, there seems to be an exaggeration of the age related decline in suppressor cell function. Whether such changes reflect accelerated changes of intrinsic lymphocyte properties or aberrant neural influences on lymphocytes remains to be resolved.
