A 'possible' optic nerve meningioma.
A 58 year old woman had progressive visual failure in her left eye over a two year period. Radiological investigation, including tomography and computerized tomographic (CT) scanning, did not result in a diagnosis. When no useful vision remained, surgical exploration disclosed an optic sheath meningioma. Complete recovery followed removal of the tumor.
