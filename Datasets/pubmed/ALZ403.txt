Xenon contrast CT CBF scanning of the brain differentiates normal age related changes from multi infarct dementia and senile dementia of Alzheimer type.
Local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) and partition coefficients (L lambda) were measured during inhalation of stable xenon gas with serial CT scanning among normal volunteers (N = 15), individuals with multi infarct dementia (MID, N = 10), and persons with senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT, N = 8). Mean gray matter flow values were reduced in both MID and SDAT. Age related declines in LCBF values in normals were marked in frontal cortex and basal ganglia. LCBF values were decreased beyond normals in frontal and temporal cortices and thalamus in MID and SDAT, in basal ganglia only in MID. Unlike SDAT and age matched normals, L lambda values were reduced in fronto temporal cortex and thalamus in MID. Multifocal nature of lesions in MID was apparent. Coefficients of variation for LCBFs were greater in MID compared with SDAT and/or age matched normals.
