Self concepts of chronically ill children.
This is an investigation of the self concept of chronically ill children with blood disease. The responses of 54 chronically ill girls and boys, aged 3 1/2 to 12, were compared with the responses of 115 healthy girls and boys, aged 3 1/2 to 10 1/2, by means of a projective drawing procedure. Few differences were found between the groups. Results were interpreted in terms of coping theory. Sex and age differences were obtained for both groups.
