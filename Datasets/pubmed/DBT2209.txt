Effect of guar gum on 24 hour insulin requirements of insulin dependent diabetic  subjects as assessed by an artificial pancreas.
The effect of guar gum on insulin requirements, mean blood glucose (MBG), and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) was investigated in seven insulin dependent diabetic subjects without endogenous insulin secretion by means of an artificial pancreas (Biostator). Fifty four hours after the withdrawal of long acting insulin, the patients were controlled for two consecutive days by the artificial pancreas, under standardized identical conditions, except for the ingestion of guar gum before meals on the second day. The 24 h insulin requirements were significantly reduced by 12.4% on the day with guar gum (P < 0.05). No statistically significant effects were observed on MGG and MAGE.
