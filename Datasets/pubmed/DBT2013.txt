Induction of L lysine 2 oxoglutarate reductase by glucagon and glucocorticoid in  developing and adult rats: in vivo and in vitro studies.
L Lysine 2 oxoglutarate reductase (EC 1.5.1.8, NADP) in the liver of adult rats increased 4 5 times when the animals were treated with alloxan. In diabetic rats injection of insulin or adrenalectomy prevented the increase in enzyme activity. The activity of the similar enzyme in kidney was not changed by these treatments. The enzyme activity in primary cultured adult rat hepatocytes was also induced by addition of dexamethasone and glucagon together, and glucagon could be replaced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Insulin inhibited the induction. The hormonal induction was also inhibited by actinomycin D and by cycloheximide. During development of rats, fetal liver showed very low activity, but the activity appeared on day 1 after birth and then increased rapidly, reaching the adult level by day 5. The activity of the kidney enzyme increased more slowly and reached adult level 1 month after birth. Intra uterine injection of glucagon caused precocious induction of the liver enzyme in fetuses. These results indicate that the activity of L lysine 2 oxoglutarate reductase in the adult liver and in part in neonatal liver also, in controlled by both glucagon and glucocorticoid.
