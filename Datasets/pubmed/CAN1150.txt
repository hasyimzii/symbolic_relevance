Correlation of hormone receptors with pathological features in human breast cancer.
Correlations have been found between certain pathologic features and estrogen and progesterone receptors status of mammary carcinoma. Well differentiated carcinomas were more frequently receptor positive than poorly differentiated tumors. An increasing degree of lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrate in the tumor was associated with a decreasing incidence of estrogen receptor activity. In addition, elastosis in primary carcinomas has been correlated with response to endocrine therapy in patients with advanced disease. With increasing amounts of elastosis in the primary tumor, there was an increase in the response rate. Also, patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors with no elastosis showed a response rate similar to that of estrogen receptor negative tumors. Hormone receptor analysis is most valuable when considered with other factors.
