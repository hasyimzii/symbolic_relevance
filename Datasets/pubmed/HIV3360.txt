Acid hydrolysis of serum samples to increase detection of HIV antigen.
Sera from 32 HIV infected patients and 20 controls were assayed for HIV antigen (HIV Ag) and antibodies following acid hydrolysis. Acid hydrolysis, followed by neutralization immediately prior to the assay, was found to be a simple means to solubilize immune complexes and allowed recovery of 40 50% of complexed antigen. Following acid hydrolysis, HIV Ag levels rose or became detectable in 22/32 patients and HIV IgG1 4 levels rose in 17/20 patients studied. The results show that complexed HIV Ag may evade detection in HIV infected patients.
