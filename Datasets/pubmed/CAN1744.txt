Gardner's syndrome. Recent developments in research and management.
In recent years, a number of comprehensive reviews have been written on inherited intestinal polyposis syndromes (1 7), but none has dealt specifically with Gardner's syndrome and none has focused on basic research being carried out in an attempt to understand this syndrome and to improve the medical management of affected patients. A better understanding of this rare genetic disorder is essential for surgeons, gastroenterologists, cancer researchers, and geneticists alike. To the clinician, it poses difficult challenges in management; to the cancer researcher, it presents a rare opportunity to study very early premalignant transformations; and to the geneticist, it poses exciting questions at the cellular, chromosomal, and molecular levels.
