Simultaneous isolation of HIV 1 and HIV 2 from an AIDS patient.
Two distinct human immunodeficiency viruses, HIV 1SF480 and HIV 2UC2 were isolated simultaneously from the blood of an Ivory Coast patient with AIDS. The HIV subtypes were segregated by their differential ability to infect established human cell lines and by the cell surface expression of type specific viral antigens. The viruses could be distinguished by both immunoblot and Southern blot analyses. The results indicate that an individual can be infected by both HIV subtypes.
