The effect of diabetes on performance and metabolism of rat hearts.
To explore the effects of diabetes on myocardial function and metabolism we injected male rats with streptozotocin and studied their hearts 8 weeks later. Blood sugar levels in the treated rats were about 600 mg/100 ml. Body and heart growth rates were diminished. When studied in an isolated working rat heart apparatus using 5.5 mM glucose, hearts of diabetic animals showed diminished cardiac output and stroke work at high filling pressures. There also were significant depressions in peak left ventricular systolic pressure, peak aortic flow rate, maximum negative dP/dt, myocardial oxygen extraction, myocardial lactate production, and effluent lactate:pyruvate ratios. Myocardial glycogen stores, calculated glycogen utilization, and pyruvate production were increased in hearts of diabetics, and myocardial oxygen consumption was the same as in control hearts. The end diastolic pressure volume relationship was shifted to the right in hearts of diabetics. Most of the abnormalities observed in hearts of diabetic rats persisted when insulin and 15 mM glucose were included in the perfusion medium. Hearts from young rats or from age matched food restricted rats with heart weights similar to those of diabetics did not show depressed function or a pressure volume shift. Our findings indicate that streptozotocin diabetes in rats results in abnormal myocardial performance. This is not due to restrictions in coronary flow or myocardial oxygenation and is not correctable by the provision of high glucose plus insulin in the perfusion medium.
