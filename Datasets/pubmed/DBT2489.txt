Long term anatomic and functional results of vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy.
A long term follow up study of 130 eyes that had had initially successful vitrectomies for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy showed that only ten (8%) eyes had significant worsening of visual acuity at final examination (18 to 68 months after surgery), compared to the best visual acuity recorded during the first six months after surgery. Active flat retinal neovascularization was present at final examination in only three eyes (2%), and in no case did elevated fibrovascular proliferation occur. The type and incidence of important complications during the early and later postoperative periods indicated a low rate of late complications.
