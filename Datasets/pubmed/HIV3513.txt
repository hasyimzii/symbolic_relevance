Syphilitic uveitis in human immunodeficiency virus infected and noninfected patients.
Seventeen patients with luetic uveitis had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and lumbar puncture to determine if the HIV positive status altered the clinical profile of syphilis. Twelve of the 17 patients tested positive for HIV. All 12 patients had abnormal lumbar punctures, but only two of the five HIV negative patients had abnormal results of spinal taps. Ocular disease also was more severe in the HIV positive group.
