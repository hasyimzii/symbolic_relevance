Pleuroma  a cancer mimicking atelectatic pseudotumor of the lung. 55 consecutive  cases studied by high KV radiography, bronchography, selective pulmonary angiography and needle biopsy.
A form of cancer  mimicking atelectatic pseudotumor of the lung called "pleuroma" is described. Since 1961 55 cases were studied by needle aspiration biopsy. Due to the usual "negative" results ("no cancer cells") of the needle biopsy, a radiographic pattern was recognized, of the basis of which the benignity of the lesion was correctly diagnosed in most cases. The radiographic appearance of these lesions was not only established with PA, lateral and oblique high KV radiographs, fluoroscopy with overpenetrated spot films, but also by bronchography, and selective pulmonary angiography. Needle biopsy was helpful in conforming a diagnosis in typical cases. However it was of paramount importance in atypical cases to recognize the lesion.
