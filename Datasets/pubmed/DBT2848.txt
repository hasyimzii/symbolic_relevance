Intra uterine deaths after suspicious, uncertain and normal antenatal fetal heart rate monitoring.
Stressed and non stressed antenatal fetal monitoring was carried out 9 520 times  in 5 932 high risk patients. Intra uterine death occurred in 48 patients. In 19 patients the fetus died within 1 week of monitoring but before the onset of labour; the results of monitoring had been normal in 14 of these. Abruptio placentae was the cause of 6 of these deaths. Many of the other causes of intra uterine death were also acute complications such as haemorrhage due to placenta praevia, amniotic fluid infection, and cord prolapse. True false negative test results were rare, and were seen most often in patients with preeclampsia, diabetes and haemolytic disease. Twin pregnancies also caused a problem, as double recording of the heart rate of the normal fetus could create a false sense of security.
