Clinical features of 100 human immunodeficiency virus antibody positive individuals from an alternate test site.
We evaluated 100 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive persons from the only alternate test site in Los Angeles. Thirty five subjects complained of systemic symptoms suggestive of HIV infection and 65 were completely asymptomatic. Irrespective of symptoms, the group as a whole demonstrated clinical and laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency. Eighty had generalized lymphadenopathy, 16 onychomycosis, six oral candidiasis, and two biopsy proved Kaposi's sarcoma. Seventy seven were anergic to seven intradermal antigens. Despite normal white blood cell counts in most subjects, the T helper cell count was less than 300/mm3 in 48% of asymptomatic and 46% of symptomatic subjects. The degree of immune depression was less severe but approximated that of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome after Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. We believe these findings justify the need for comprehensive medical evaluation and follow up care for seropositive persons from alternate test sites.
