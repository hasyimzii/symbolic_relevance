AIDS prevention and control in Japan.
Surveillance for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Japan started in September 1984 and in February 1987 was extended to seropositive carriers of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. A total of 2,000 hospitals and clinics throughout the country have actively participated in the surveillance. An educational program for health care workers, including physicians, was initiated in July 1985 by issuing a series of government memoranda and distributing pamphlets and posters. Counseling programs for people concerned about AIDS and laboratory support to provide screening services have been developed. Laboratories that can also perform confirmatory tests will be established shortly. The screening of all donated blood was established in November 1986. Education programs for the public have been conducted mainly through the production and distribution of various materials and pamphlets. Research has been focused primarily on diagnosis and treatment, with international cooperation emphasized. A new act of legislation has been proposed in the Parliament that will require mandatory reporting of cases of AIDS and HIV infection with confidentiality preserved. Further debate may be needed to reach national consensus on this issue. The proposed law will not include provisions that would affect international travelers, foreign students or immigrants.
