Computerized data base for evaluation and follow up of demented outpatients.
In the course of evaluating and following more than 600 geriatric outpatients referred to a subspecialty clinic because of cognitive impairment, standardized computer compatible evaluation and follow up forms were developed, as well as a computerized data base. The forms cover medical, neurologic, psychiatric, psychometric, and clinical laboratory examinations; they help health professionals to perform thorough, standardized, and efficient examinations focused on those characteristics relevant to dementias. The computerized data base facilitates follow up and other clinical studies. This article presents both the forms and their translation into query language terminology.
