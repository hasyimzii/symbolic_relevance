Arteriography of sacrococcygeal teratomas.
Sacrococcygeal teratomas often present at birth as skin covered caudal masses. Because of the variable intrapelvic and presacral extension of these tumors, high mortality from hemorrhage, variable blood supply, and occasional confusion with other caudal masses, preoperative arteriography is useful. The arteriographic findings in 4 neonates with sacrococcygeal teratoma are presented.
