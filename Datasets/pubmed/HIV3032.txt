Pseudotype viruses bearing envelope antigens of Japanese isolates of human T cell leukemia viruses type I.
We tried to transmit human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV I) into non lymphoid cells and found that S+L  CCC cat cells were permissive for HTLV I. Using these HTLV positive cat cells, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes bearing envelope antigens of Japanese isolates of HTLVs were prepared and their reactivities with human or rabbit serum were examined. Japanese HTLV2M, HTLV10Y, and HTLVMT 2 pseudotypes and American HTLVPL pseudotype were neutralized by sera of Japanese and American patients with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and rabbit antisera against HTLV. Each serum showed similar antibody titers against different pseudotypes. Thus, envelope antigens of four HTLVs that reacted with the human and rabbit sera were considered to belong to a single serotype.
