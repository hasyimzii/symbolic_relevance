Mnesic function in 5 patients suffering from central idiopathic diabetes insipidus (author's transl).
Mnesic function has been tested in 5 patients suffering from central idiopathic diabetes insipidus 3 days after withdrawal of treatment (DDAVP) and 3 days after substitutive therapy. In general basal scores are low but no specific profile of disturbances has been found, except a general low score at the Benton test. Substitutive therapy induces a general improvement of the scores, mainly in the patients who did show the lower performances before treatment. Although our results are in agreement with positive action of vasopressin on mnesic function, we cannot ascertained that the observed effect is solely due to a central action of the hormone, since some metabolic consequences of the hormone administration (i.e. relapse of nycturia and consequently of sleep disturbances) could have indirect effects of cognitive function.
