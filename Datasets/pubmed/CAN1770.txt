Arterial catheter embolization in gastroduodenal hemorrhages.
The arterial catheter embolization was used in 11 of 14 patients with profuse gastroduodenal hemorrhages. The results showed high efficiency of the method. The described method, the level of the occlusion thus obtained allowed avoiding possible complications and gave good hemostatic effect. The authors discuss the indications for the endovascular catheter embolization. An original method of embolization of the left ventricular artery is described.
