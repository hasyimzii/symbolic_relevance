The chlorpropamide alcohol flush. Lack of specificity for familial non insulin dependent diabetes.
A facial flush provoked by alcohol in chlorpropamide treated diabetics has been described as a genetic marker for a dominantly inherited type of non insulin dependent diabetes. In this study a chlorpropamide alcohol flush was observed in 16.9% of control subjects (n = 154), 23.3% of insulin dependent diabetics (n = 437) and 16.5% of patients with non insulin dependent diabetes (n = 145). Among the non insulin dependent diabetics no difference in the frequency of the chlorpropamide alcohol flush was found between those with and without a family history of diabetes. Specificity was not improved by skin temperature measurement or additional placebo tests. According to these data the chlorpropamide alcohol flush does not seem to be specific for non insulin dependent diabetes and hypotheses about the aetiology of this type of diabetes based on the chlorpropamide alcohol flush should be regarded with caution.
