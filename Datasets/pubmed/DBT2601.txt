Blockade of chlorpropamide alcohol flushing by indomethacin suggests an association between prostaglandins and diabetic vascular complications.
Chlorpropamide/alcohol flushing (CPAF), found in many patients with non insulin dependent diabetes (NIDD), can be blocked by indomethacin in most patients who are free of vascular complications but not in those with such complications. Since indomethacin is a prostaglandin inhibitor this finding suggests that prostaglandins may be involved in the aetiology of vascular diseases in NIDD. All 6 pairs of identical twins with CPAF, of whom 2 pairs were disocrdant for diabetes, were concordant for indomethacin blocking, which suggests that the block has a genetic basis. The difference in the response of CPAF to indomethacin in diabetic patients with and without vascular complications is probably the first indication of a metabolic difference between these two types of patient.
