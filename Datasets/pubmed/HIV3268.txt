Development of antiviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection.
Antiviral agents under investigation for the treatment of patients infected with  the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are reviewed. Multiple mechanisms exist by which antiviral agents might inhibit the replication of HIV or eradicate its latent form in affected cells, or both. These mechanisms include (1) interference with the cell surface receptor for HIV, (2) prevention of uncoating of viral particles, (3) inhibition of reverse transcriptase, (4) prevention of integration and posttranscription processing, (5) interference with viral assembly, and (6) interference with virus release. Most agents developed thus far work by inhibiting HIV reverse transcriptase. Suramin, ribavirin, ammonium 21 tungsten 9 antimoniate (HPA 23), foscarnet (phosphonoformate, PFA), inosine pranobex (isoprinosine), peptide T, ampligen, AL 721, dideoxycytidine, and zidovudine (formerly azidothymidine) have antiretroviral activity in vitro. To date zidovudine is the only antiretroviral agent approved by the FDA as clinically effective. However, zidovudine has serious toxicities, including neutropenia and anemia; in some patients dosage reduction or cessation of therapy may be necessary. Because treatment with zidovudine does not cure HIV infection, numerous studies are under way with other anti HIV agents. Ultimately, combinations of agents probably will be used to suppress or eradicate HIV. While the search for more efficacious and less toxic treatments continues, the development of zidovudine in such a short time provides hope that progress toward a cure will be made rapidly.
