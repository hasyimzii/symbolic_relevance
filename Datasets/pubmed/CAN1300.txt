Spontaneous cytotoxicity of rheumatoid and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells against 4 human lymphoblastoid cell lines.
By measuring spontaneous cytotoxicity of unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and from normal individuals against 4 human lymphoblastoid cell lines we have been unable to demonstrate any preferential recognition of antigens on these cell lines by rheumatoid patients.
