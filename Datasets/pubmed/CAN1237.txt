Transaxillary pleurectomy for treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax.
In the 16 year period 1962 to 1978, 409 transaxillary apical pleurectomies were carried out for definitive treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax in 362 patients. Surgical indications included recurrence (336), bilaterality of the disease (23), persistent air leak (22), and nonexpansion of the lung (10). There was 1 operative death (unsuspected brain tumor), and 3 patients required reexploration for clot removal. The average postoperative period of hospitalization was 6 days. Three hundred ten patients (86% of all patients) were contacted for follow up 1 to 16 years after operation (average, 4.5 years). There were two documented episodes of recurrent ipsilateral pneumothorax (0.6%). Postoperative pulmonary function studies were done in 40 patients (unilateral, 29; bilateral, 11) 2 to 5 years after operation. The results indicate that there are no significant abnormalities compared with predicted values.
