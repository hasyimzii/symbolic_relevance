Human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV I) associated adult T cell leukemia lymphoma in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1).
A patient had adult T cell leukemia lymphoma in the unusual setting of coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV I). The leukemic cells were CD4 positive and showed clonal genetic rearrangement of the T cell receptor complex. Cytogenetic analysis showed three clonal karyotypic abnormalities: trisomy 3 and two translocations [t(1;15), (X;1)]. The patient was seropositive for HIV and HTLV I; HTLV I and HIV 1 DNA sequences were detected in peripheral blood leukocytes by the polymerase chain reaction. The HTLV I sequences were detected in a relatively high proportion of mononuclear cells (at least 1 in 30 cells), whereas HIV 1 sequences were detected in a smaller proportion of cells (at least 1 in 3000 cells). Clinical remission was achieved after chemotherapy. There was a decrease in the proportion of HTLV I positive mononuclear cells (at least 1 in 1000 cells), whereas the proportion of HIV 1 positive cells was relatively unchanged (at least 1 in 1000 cells). Adult T cell leukemia lymphoma in the setting of HIV coinfection may become increasingly common because asymptomatic retroviral coinfections are frequent.
