Wide variation in serum chlorpropamide concentration in outpatients.
Serum chlorpropamide concentrations (s CPA) were determined and related to clinical findings in 83 outpatients with maturity onset diabetes. The daily doses of CPA (mg/kg) varied six fold, but s CPA ranged 18 fold between the patients. There was a significant correlation between dose and s CPA (r = 0.61), which rose to 0.75 in the 30 patients who had prescribed no other drugs. Patients given other drugs concomitantly were over represented amongst subjects with extreme values of apparent plasma clearance of CPA. There was no correlation either between serum creatinine or age and s CPA. Of the 83 patients 40 (48%) had acceptable blood and urinary glucose values according to our criteria; but as 17 were overweight, only 23 patients (28%) had acceptable clinical control. Of the remaining 60 patients, too low a dose was being given to only 12, and dietary failure was the most probable explanation in the others. Thirteen patients (16%) probably did not need CPA. It is likely that this is a partial explanation for the high utilisation of oral antidiabetic drugs in Sweden. There was no general correlation between dose or s CPA and blood glucose values, but analysis of s CPA may still be of value in explaining unexpected changes in clinical control.
