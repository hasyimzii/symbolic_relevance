Decreased incidence of HLA A11 and increased incidence of HLA B8 in a North American population of insulin dependent diabetics.
Seventy four North American Caucasian insulin dependent diabetics are presented and compared to 100 healthy controls relative to HLA A and B locus antigens. A highly significant increase in the frequency of HLA B8 was found (p < 0.01, relative risk 3.67). The presence of HLA A11 conferred statistically significant protection against disease development in these patients (p < 0.01, relative risk 0.19). There was no significant difference in the frequency of HLA B7, B8, or B15 between the study and control groups. The patient group does show a significant increase in heterozygosity for HLA B8 and HLA B15 when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05, relative risk 7.17). Increased incidence of HLA B18 has previously been noted in French and English populations only. Since most of our HLA B18 patients are of English extraction, it is concluded tht the altered incidence of the HLA B18 allele in insulin dependent diabetes does persist in this migratory European population.
