Alterations in circulating vitamin D metabolites in the young insulin dependent diabetic.
To assess the relationship between the decreased bone mass observed in young insulin requiring diabetic patients and vitamin D metabolism, we measured serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D, 24,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D concentration in 45 white, insulin dependent diabetic subjects, 7 18 yr of age. Metacarpal cortical thickness in 87% of these diabetics was below the mean for their respective ages, while 16% had a cortical thickness value greater than 2 sDs below the mean. Serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were normal, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone was in the low normal range, and total serum alkaline phosphatase was elevated compared to age  and sex matched controls. Circulating 24,25 dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations were significantly elevated, and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D was significantly decreased. The increase in 24,25 dihydroxyvitamin D was greater in the diabetics with the most severe bone loss and was maximally increased during the first 5 yr of clinical diabetes. No apparent correlation was seen between metabolic control, as measured by hemoglobin A1C and urine and plasma glucose, and the circulating levels of the vitamin D metabolites. Despite appropriate insulin replacement, alterations in vitamin D metabolism occur in the young insulin dependent diabetic and could relate to the decrease in cortical bone mass observed in these patients.
