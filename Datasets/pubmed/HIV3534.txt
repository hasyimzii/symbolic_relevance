HIV 1 specific antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid mediate cellular cytotoxicity and neutralization.
Antibodies mediating HIV 1 specific cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and virus neutralizing activity were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, as previously reported, in sera of subjects with varying severity of HIV 1 infection, including patients with or without neurologic or psychiatric symptoms. ADCC mediating antibodies against target cells infected with the HTLV IIIB strain of HIV 1 were less frequently present in CSF than in sera, 32 and 60%, respectively. The frequency of ADCC positive CSF was comparable for the different clinical stages of the disease and was apparently not influenced by the presence or absence of neurologic/psychiatric symptoms. Virus neutralizing activity was tested against HTLV IIIB and one CSF derived viral isolate. Serum antibodies neutralized HTLV IIIB more frequently than the CSF isolate, 53 and 35%, respectively. In contrast, only three (7%) of the CSF specimens contained neutralizing activity to the CSF derived isolate and none to HTLV IIIB. Despite an intact blood brain barrier in many subjects, the serum/CSF ratios of ADCC or neutralizing antibodies were lower than normally expected. This indicates that both ADCC mediating and virus neutralizing antibodies may be intrathecally synthesized. Whether these antibodies are protective against or contribute to the histopathologic changes in the brain is not known at present.
