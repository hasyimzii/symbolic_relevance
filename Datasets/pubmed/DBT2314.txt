Behaviour of insulin antibodies in diabetics treated with different insulins.
Determinations of insulin antibodies in 116 insulin dependent diabetics treated successively with various types on insulin and in a group of 55 diabetics who received a single insulin type from the onset of the disease, revealed higher titers in those under treatment with conventional insulins, particularly Insulin Novo Lente. The mean titer of insulin antibodies is considered to be related to the insulin demands and sometimes to the length of disease. The presence of antibodies was also recorded after administration of highly purified insulins, but much more seldom and with lower titers, which could be an argument for a wider utilization of such products.
