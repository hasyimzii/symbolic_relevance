Liver alterations in antituberculosis regimens containing pyrazinamide.
A group of alcoholic tuberculous patients was given a pyrazinamide containing regimen, and the liver was studied on admission and after two months of intensive treatment with IRSZ. Alterations in liver histology and in liver function tests found on admission improved or disappeared after two months' chemotherapy. A control group, give IRSE, showed similar results. A third group of nonalcoholic patients was given Z alone for 15 days, and liver tolerance was also excellent. These data support the conclusion that tuberculous alcoholic patients, in the absence of significant and persistent hepatic dysfunction, can be given Z containing regimens. In all cases, a careful monitoring of hepatic function, with monthly SGPT and bilirubin determinations, is recommended.
