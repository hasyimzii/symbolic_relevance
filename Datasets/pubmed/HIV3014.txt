Tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteriosis, and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome among Haitian and non Haitian patients in south Florida.
To study the association between mycobacterial disease and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, we reviewed the records of all cases of tuberculosis and all cases of the syndrome reported in Dade County, Florida, from January 1980 through June 1983. Tuberculosis was diagnosed in 27 of 45 Haitians with the syndrome, but in only 1 of 37 non Haitians with the syndrome (p less than 0.001). Among the 27 Haitians with the syndrome and tuberculosis, 19 had extrapulmonary tuberculosis, whereas among 286 Haitian patients with tuberculosis without the syndrome, only 56 had extrapulmonary tuberculosis (p less than 0.001). Tuberculosis preceded the syndrome by 1 to 17 months (mean, 6) in 22 patients. In 10 patients with the syndrome and positive sputum cultures who were treated with conventional antituberculosis drugs, the cultures became negative within 1 to 4 months and tuberculosis did not recur. The frequency of disseminated atypical mycobacteriosis or positive sputum cultures for atypical mycobacteria was not significantly different between Haitian (11.3%) and non Haitian (8.3%) patients with the syndrome.
