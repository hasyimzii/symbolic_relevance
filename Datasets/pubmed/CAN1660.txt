Kinetic changes in the cellular proliferation of Ehrlich ascites tumor as affected by low intensity laser radiation.
A radiographical study, using 3H thymidine, has shown that, under the influence of He Ne laser irradiation, the enhancement of the Ehrlich ascite tumour growth is associated with a shorter duration of the mitotic cycle which, in turn, is due to the decrease of all its phases. Besides, the enhancement is related to the increase of proliferative pool.
