Use of precautions by nurse midwives to prevent occupational infections with HIV  and other blood borne diseases.
A questionnaire was designed with these objectives: (1) to determine the frequency and type of adverse exposures experienced by certified nurse midwives (CNMs); (2) to determine the extent to which CNMs used recommended precautions to prevent such incidents; and (3) to identify the sources used for obtaining information on AIDS. The questionnaire was mailed to all CNMs with the exception of associate and student members of the American College of Midwives. A response rate of 1,784/2,963 (60.2%) was obtained. These midwives reported frequent exposures to blood and body fluids. Sixty five percent reported being soaked to the skin with blood or amniotic fluid; 50.7% had face splashes with blood or amniotic fluid; and 24.0% experienced one or more needlestick(s). Only 55.1% reported using Universal Precautions (UP). Interference with the midwife client relationship was identified most frequently as the reason for not using UP. Strategies need to be developed for midwives that will increase the use of UP and minimize the frequency of adverse exposures, while maintaining a caring midwife client relationship.
