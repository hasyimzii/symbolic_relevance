Active immunization of homosexual men using a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine.
Twenty homosexual men [13 anti human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, seven anti HIV negative] without HBsAg, anti HBs, and anti HBc were vaccinated with three 20 micrograms doses of a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. All anti HIV positive homosexuals were nonresponders independent of the initial number of CD4 positive cells. Among seven anti HIV negative individuals, five responded. After three doses of the vaccine, CD4 positive cells fell in anti HIV positive individuals by 22.4%. A similar fall in CD4 positive cells of an average 24.9% was noted in 17 matching, but nonvaccinated, anti HIV positive homosexuals. The study indicates that the efficacy of vaccination in anti HIV positive individuals is questionable. There is, however, no evidence that vaccination against hepatitis B might be harmful to anti HIV positive subjects.
