Anti env and anti gag antibodies in subjects infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
Antibodies to antigens codified by the env and gag genes of HIV were separately assayed for in the sera of 150 infected people. From a practical standpoint, enzyme immunoassay was a more convenient and reliable technique than Western blot. Anti env was positive in 100% and anti gag in 70% of the cases. A positive anti env test was confirmatory of serological diagnosis, but lacked any prognostic value. A higher frequency of negative results for anti gag antibody was significantly associated with the presence of more severe clinical manifestations, more profound impairment of lymphocyte subpopulations (especially CD4 cells), and the finding of HIV antigens in blood. The absence of anti gag antibodies, which seem to behave as protective, is an unfavorable feature in the clinical and immunological evaluation of patients.
