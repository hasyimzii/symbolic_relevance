Studies on the insulin mediator. II. Separation of two antagonistic biologically  active materials from fraction II.
Insulin treatment significantly altered the elution profile of deproteinized muscle extracts chromatographed on Sephadex G 25 columns, particularly in fraction II, which contains the insulin mediator. Further purification of fraction II by high voltage paper electrophoresis at pH 1.9 and 3.5 resulted in two active fractions. Fraction 1 leads to 4 stimulated the cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase and inhibited glycogen synthase phosphoprotein phosphatase, and may be a novel substance. Fractions 1 leads to 6 and 3 leads to 6 inhibited the cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase and stimulated glycogen synthase phosphatase. It is proposed that the insulin mediator is present in fractions 1 leads to 6 and 3 leads to 6.
