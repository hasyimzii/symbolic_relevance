Dementia in Down's syndrome: observations from a neurology clinic.
Clinical manifestations of dementia were reviewed in 15 Down's syndrome (DS) patients referred to a neurological clinic over a 24 month period for mental deterioration. The ages ranged from 32 64 years. One hundred percent showed personality changes and loss of independent daily living skills, the presenting symptoms in two thirds of the cases. Other manifestations included seizures (53%), gait deterioration (73%), sphincteric incontinence (40%), and pathological release reflexes (67%). All 7 patients with CT scans showed moderate or severe central and peripheral cortical atrophy. Detailed clinical information is presented for two patients, one of whom showed a temporary remission with imipramine. A characteristic dementia syndrome appears to be present in a subpopulation of aging DA patients with radiographic findings of Alzheimer's disease.
