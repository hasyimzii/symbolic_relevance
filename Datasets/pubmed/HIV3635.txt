trans activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is sequence specific for  both the single stranded bulge and loop of the trans acting responsive hairpin: a quantitative analysis.
We have used site directed mutagenesis to delineate sequence specific domains within the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) trans acting responsive (TAR) RNA element that are required for trans activation by the viral Tat protein. Our data in part corroborate a recent report [S. Feng and E. C. Holland, Nature (London) 334:165 167, 1988] that five nucleotides within the loop (+29 to +33) of the TAR hairpin are important for trans activation. We, however, found no absolute requirement for the CUGGG loop sequence. Mutants with substitutions within the loop retained between 9 and 50% activity compared with the wild type. A second sequence, important for trans activation, was found in the 3 base bulge loop (+22 to +24) of the TAR hairpin. Cross trans activation studies of mutant HIV 1 TAR elements with the HIV 2 Tat protein suggest that a similar recognition event(s) forms the basis for trans activation of HIV 1 and HIV 2.
