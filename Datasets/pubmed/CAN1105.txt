Second look operations in ovarian cancer.
One hundred eighty six patients with epithelial tumors of the ovary who were managed at the M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute underwent an exploratory operation ("second look" operation) to assess the status of the cancer. Fifty eight patients were found to have no evidence of disease (NED) and chemotherapy was discontinued. Eight patients with advanced ovarian cancer had NED 5 or more years after negative second look operations and were probably cured by chemotherapy. Seven patients who were found to have cancer at second look operations had a change in management as a result of the operation and had NED 5 or more years later. The most important factors correlating with negative second look operations were the stage of cancer, the amount of residual tumor left at the initial operation, and the number of courses of chemotherapy administered prior to the second look operation. Survival after positive second look operations varied directly with the volume of tumor found at the time of operation and the amount of tumor left behind at the second look operation. Patients who were treated with radiation therapy had a poorer survival rate than those who were treated with chemotherapy after positive second look operations.
