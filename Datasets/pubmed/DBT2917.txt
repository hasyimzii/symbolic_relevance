Aortoiliac occlusive disease: factors influencing survival and function following reconstructive operation over a twenty five year period.
During a period of slightly over 25 years, 949 new patients with aortoiliac atherosclerotic occlusive disease  409 (43%) with associated distal disease  were submitted to various reconstructive operations for claudication in 719 and rest ischemic problems in 230 patients. The ages ranged from 21 to 91 years with a medial age of 59. Men outnumbered women 2.5 to 1. Associated diseases were present in 695 (75%); heart disease and diabetes were most common. The mortality rate from operation  50% of which was from heart disease  8% in first 5 years and 3% during the last 15 years. Good function, i.e., restoration of femoral pulses, leg salvage, and relief of symptoms, was achieved in 95% of cases early after treatment. Early results were best in patients with claudication and those without associated distal disease. The long term survival rates were significant  50%, 30%, and 15% at 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively  and successful function was maintained in survivors in 79%, 70%, and 56% at the same intervals. Amputation was performed in only 23 (3%) patients with claudication and 33 (14%) with rest ischemia during the period of study. Survival, functional results, and incidence of amputation varied with the numerous factors described in detail herein.
