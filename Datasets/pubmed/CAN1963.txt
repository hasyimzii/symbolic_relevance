Increased sensitivity of fibroblasts of skin from patients with adenomatosis coli and Peutz Jegher's syndrome to transformation by murine sarcoma virus.
Skin fibroblasts from family members of cases of adenomatosis coli (AC) and Peutz Jegher's syndrome (PJ) were examined for susceptibility to morphological transformation by Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV) of rate 78AI cells, which was found in the present study to contain both dualtropic and ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV). The fibroblasts from individuals with manifest AC (22 subjects) and manifest PJ (5 subjects) were up to 5 times more susceptible to transformation by rat 78AI MSV(MLV) than those from normal individuals (7 subjects). Nonmanifest members of AC families (8 subjects) showed various sensitivities: the fibroblasts from 3 family members had a sensitivity as low as that of normal cells, and those of 5 individuals exhibited increased sensitivity similar to that of manifest cases of AC. The AC and PJ cells that were sensitive to 78AI MSV(MLV) were also susceptible to transformation by other pseudo types of Moloney MSV, although they were not transformed by infection of standard Moloney MSV. None of the fibroblasts were transformed by xenotropic MLV alone. The tumor promoter 12 O tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 acetate enhanced transformation by 78AI MSV(MLV) in both AC and normal cells.
