Stimulation of the basal nucleus of Meynert in senile dementia of Alzheimer's type. A preliminary report.
The basal nuclei of Meynert are the principal sources of cholinergic innervation  of the cerebral cortex. It has been hypothesized that the depressed cortical glucose metabolic activity in senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT) may result primarily from diminished activity and loss of these cells. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the basal nuclei would bring about clinical improvement and increase cortical glucose metabolic activity in SDAT. An electrode was implanted in September 1984 into the left basal nucleus of a 74 year old man with SDAT. Repetitive cycles of stimulation for 9 months since have had no definite effect clinically but a follow up positron emission tomography scan shows that cortical glucose metabolic activity was preserved in the ipsilateral temporal and parietal lobes while it declined elsewhere in the cortex.
