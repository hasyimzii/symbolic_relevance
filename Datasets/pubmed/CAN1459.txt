Comparison of adriamycin  and ouabain induced cytotoxicity and inhibition of 86rubidium transport in wild type and ouabain resistant C3H/10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts.
Ouabain (OUA) inhibited 86Rb uptake (50% inhibitory concentration = 0.8 X 10( 4)  M) over concentration ranges close to those at which it caused a reversible cytotoxicity (50% lethal dose = 2.5 X 10( 4) M) in growing wild type C3H/10T1/2 cells. On the other hand, Adriamycin (ADM) inhibited 86Rb uptake (50% inhibitory concentration = 2 X 10( 3) M) but at concentrations 10(4) fold higher than those causing irreversible cytotoxicity in growing wild type cells (50% lethal dose = 3 X 10( 8) M). While OUA inhibited 86Rb uptake more in wild type cells than in a OUA resistant mutant, ADM inhibited 86Rb uptake to the same extent in confluent wild type and OUA resistant cells. Further, three OUA resistant mutants were not cross resistant to ADM  or daunomycin (DM) induced cytotoxicity during log phase or to ADM induced cytotoxicity at confluence. In addition, ADM, DM, or 5 iminodaunomycin did not displace the cardiac glycosides digoxin or digitoxin from their respective antibody complexes. The order of potency of anthracycline derivatives in inhibiting 86Rb uptake in confluent wild type cells was the same as their order of inhibiting the growth of wild type cells and in detaching confluent wild type cells (DM > ADM > 5 iminodaunomycin) but did not correlate with their cardiotoxic potentials (ADM > DM > 5 iminodaunomycin). Therefore, in this model system, ADM cytotoxicity is mediated differently from OUA cytotoxicity. Further, we find no biological evidence consistent withADM binding to the OUA site on the cell surface (Na+ K+) adenosine triphosphatase and therefore no evidence in this model system that ADM cardiotoxicity could be a digitalis type toxicity per se.
