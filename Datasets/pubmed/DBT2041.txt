Histologic observations of pleomorphic corynebacterium like microorganisms in diabetic scleredema adultorum.
Diabetic scleredema adultorum is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized  by scleroderma like changes, usually affecting the skin of the neck, shoulders, and upper back in diabetics. Presented herein are two cases in which pleomorphic, but predominantly coccoid forms, were observed in acid fast, Giemsa, and Gram stained tissue, sections of the affected skin. Culture of the skin was positive for a microaerophilic, corynebacterium like organism in one case and an anaerobic Propionibacterium (Corynebacterium) sp in the other case. The morphologic appearance of the bacterial isolates greatly resembled the morphologic forms observed in the tissue sections, suggesting that bacteria, possibly in a cell wall deficient phase, may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Findings of similar bacteria in previously reported cases of other connective tissue disorders such as sclerodermiformis, and rheumatoid arthritis, might support our idea that bacteria could supply the antigenic stimulus for the production of scleredema.
