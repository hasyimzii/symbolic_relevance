Histocompatibility antigen frequencies in diabetic retinopathy.
We studied the histocompatibility antigens A and B in 300 insulin dependent diabetics: 200 had proliferative retinopathy and 100 did not. The two groups were matched for known duration of diabetes and other clinical features. In both groups the frequencies of HLA B8, HLA B18, and HLA B8/HLA B15 were significantly higher, and those of HLA B7 and HLA B12 were significantly lower than in healthy controls. The patients with proliferative retinopathy were significantly less often positive for HLA B7 (X2 = 10.0; Pc < .03) than patients with nonproliferative retinopathy. When both groups were stratified for age at diagnosis, there were additional differences. HLA B15 was significantly more frequent in the proliferative retinopathy group with age at diagnosis between 15 and 40 years (nonproliferative retinopathy = 16.4%; proliferative retinopathy = 39.4%; X2 = 7.89, Pc < .03; relative risk = 3.32) and HLA B7 significantly less frequent (nonproliferative retinopathy = 23.6%; proliferative retinopathy = 5.6%; X2 = 8.0, Pc < .03; relative risk = 0.19). These differences in histocompatibility frequencies between patients with and without proliferative retinopathy indicate a genetic contribution to diabetic retinopathy.
