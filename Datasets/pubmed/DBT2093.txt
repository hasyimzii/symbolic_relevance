Direct streptozotocin toxicity on dispersed mouse islet cells determined by 51Cr release.
Dispersed islet cells were prepared from collagenase isolated lean mouse pancreatic islets by Dispase II and subsequent mechanical treatment in calcium depleted media. An average yield of 600 cells per islet was obtained, 84% of the cells being beta cells. Cells were incubated with radioactive chromium as a marker of cell viability. Optimal labelling of 1  2 cpm per cell was obtained by incubating 10(5) cells with 10(6) cpm of [51]Cr for 90 min. When islet cells were incubated with streptozotocin, this drug induced [51]Cr release after a lag time of 2  4 hours. Furthermore, a positive correlation between streptozotocin concentrations and [51]Cr release was found. This assay of cytotoxicity was highly reproducible and might be applicable in the study of other beta cell damaging agents or autoimmune phenomena in the pathogenesis of diabetes.
