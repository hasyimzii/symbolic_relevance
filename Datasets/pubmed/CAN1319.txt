The surgical treatment of pathologic and impending pathologic fractures of the long bones.
The results of operative treatment of 83 pathologic fractures and 17 impending pathologic fractures of the long bones are reported. The results of a group of 53 patients who underwent an osteosynthesis only are compared with those of a group of 43 patients who were subsequently treated 47 times with an osteosynthesis in combination with bone cement. With regard to the degree of mobilization there is a statistically significant difference in favor of the group treated with bone cement. The incidence of complications is low. Immediate use of the involved extremity in these patients minimizes complications associated with prolonged immobilization and enhances the quality of the remainder of their lives.
