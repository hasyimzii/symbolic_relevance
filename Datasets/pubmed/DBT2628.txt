Somatotyping in the obese children and adolescents.
Age related somatic variability studied by 15 anthropometric parameters was assessed in 278 subjects (138 boys and 140 girls) aged between 5 and 20 years. Of these, 30% had simple obesity, 10.0% obesity associated with hypothyroidism, 10.0% obesity with diabetes, 25% obesity with adrenocortical reaction, 23.5% functional adiposo genital syndrome and 1.5% Cushing's syndrome. The peculiarities related to the somatic development as a whole, the degree of bone development, and adiposity are interpreted in the main clinical forms of obesity, on the basis of the morphogram.
