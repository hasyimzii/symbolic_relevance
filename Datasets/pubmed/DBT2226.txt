Cells cultured from the diabetic (DB/DB) mouse have a permanent decrease in insulin receptors.
Investigation of mechanisms responsible for the decreased numbers of insulin receptors observed in obesity and diabetes has been facilitated by the development of cell culture systems permitting study of cellular events independent of fluctuating hormone levels and multiple endocrine interactions present in the whole organism. With such a system, we have found that cells cultured from the skin of diabetic mice have 45 48% fewer receptors for insulin than those from nondiabetic littermates. This difference is maintained in culture over many generations, suggesting that the decreased expression of insulin receptors in these cells is related to the genetic trait for diabetes.
