Mutagenicity of hydroxamic acids and the probable involvement of carbamoylation.
A series of hydroxamic acids (aceto , propiono , benzo , and p nitrobenzo ) and seven derivatives of these were examined for biological activity using Salmonella typhimurium. Acylation to yield O acetyl and O benzoyl derivatives markedly enhanced toxic properties and was necessary for mutagenic activity for all but p nitrobenzohydroxamic acid. The dose necessary to produce a minimum significant mutagenic response varied from 21 microM for O benzoyl benzohydroxamate to 430 microM for O acetyl acetohydroxamate. These two compounds were also tested with human lymphoblasts to which they were toxic at 100 microM but not mutagenic. O Acetyl benzohydroxamate, a mutagen, was prepared wih a 14C label in the carbonyl carbon atom of the benzoyl group and was shown to form an adduct in vitro with DNA and polyguanylic acid. The level of binding was 1 mol of 14C per 5 X 10(4) mol of DNA phosphate and 1 mol of 14C per 10(5) mol of polyguanylic acid phosphate.
