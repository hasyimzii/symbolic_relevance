Determination of desferoxamine and a major metabolite by high performance liquid  chromatography. Application to the treatment of aluminium related disorders.
A high performance liquid chromatography method is described that permits separation and quantification of desferoxamine, a major metabolite, the iron(III) and the aluminum(III) chelates of desferoxamine. This method now facilitates pharmacokinetic studies on desferoxamine and derivatives designed to study side effects and metabolite patterns in patients undergoing treatment.
