Mother to infant transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1: association with prematurity or low anti gp120.
In a prospective study of pregnant women infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) in Brooklyn, New York, USA, 16 (29%) of 55 evaluable infants were infected with HIV 1. 9 infants had paediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 6 had less severe clinical manifestations of HIV 1 infection, and 1 was symptom free but was seropositive for HIV 1 beyond 15 months of age. The 10 infants born at 37 weeks of gestation or earlier were at higher risk of HIV 1 infection than infants born at 38 weeks of gestation or later (60% vs 22%) but the median age at appearance of disease was approximately 5 months in both groups. The HIV 1 transmission rate was not associated with predelivery levels of maternal T cells, anti p24, or neutralising antibodies but it was higher, among full term infants, for those with mothers in the lowest third of the distribution of anti gp120 levels (53%). On immunoblot, transmitting mothers lacked a gp120 band but not other bands. Protection was not associated with antibody to recombinant peptides from the hypervariable region of the major neutralising gp120 epitope, and the anti gp120 endpoint dilution titre was similar in transmitting and non transmitting mothers. Mothers of uninfected full term infants appear to confer immunological protection against HIV 1 infection of their offspring by way of a high affinity antibody to a gp120 epitope, whose specificity has importance for vaccine development and possibly perinatal immunotherapy.
