Impairment of pituitary and gonadal functions in alloxan induced diabetic male rats.
The inhibitory effect of treatment with a potent LHRH agonist on testicular gonadotropin receptor levels was compared in intact and diabetic rats. Basal and LHRH induced pituitary gonadotropin secretion as well as the testicular steroidogenic response to oLH were assessed. A single injection of alloxan (65 mg/kg) led, after 6 weeks, to a 40% decrease of testicular LH  and prolactin receptor levels. Treatment for 2 weeks with [D Ala6,des Gly NH 1/2 0] LHRH ethylamide (100 ng every second day) led to a 70% reduction of LH receptor levels accompanied by decreased testicular weight, a similar inhibition being found in intact and diabetic animals. Seminal vesicle and ventral prostate weight were markedly reduced in diabetic animals, a further decrease being obtained after treatment with the LHRH agonist. The loss of accessory sex organ weight in alloxan diabetic rats was accompanied by a reduction in the basal testicular content of pregnenolone, progesterone, 17 OH progesterone, androstenedione, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone whereas the steroid response to oLH was within normal limits. We next examined the possible changes of LH and FSH secretion which could be responsible for the reduced testicular function in diabetic animals. Basal plasma LH levels were 30% reduced in rats 6 weeks after treatment with alloxan while basal plasma FSH levels remained unchanged. When the pituitary gonadotropin response to LHRH was measured in chronically cannulated freely moving intact and diabetic rats, an approx. 50% inhibition of the LH and FSH responses to LHRH was observed in diabetic animals.
