Prognosis concerning HIV infection and AIDS epidemic in The Netherlands based on mathematical analysis.
In the Netherlands by the 1st of January 1990 1074 AIDS patients have been reported to the Department of the Chief Medical Officer. In the last few years the proportion of intravenous drug users increased and the proportion of homo/bisexual men decreased. After adjustment for the effect of delay in reporting the total number of AIDS patients by 1st January 1990 is estimated to be 1173. It appears that the reporting delay outside Amsterdam is longer than in this city. The time required for doubling of the half yearly incidence of new AIDS patients (doubling time, dt) increased from 9 months in the beginning of the epidemic to 34 months. It is expected on the assumption of constant dt that 1120 new AIDS patients will be diagnosed in 1990 and 1991 together. The present growth among the homo/bisexual men (dt 34 months) is smaller than the one among the intravenous drug users (dt 23 months). The growth in Amsterdam (dt 36 months) is less than that in the rest of the Netherlands (dt 32 months). Based on the course of the AIDS epidemic the number of HIV infected (including the AIDS patients) is estimated as 9,000 12,000 by the 1st of January 1990.
