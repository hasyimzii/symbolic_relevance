Sorbitol in the accessory glands of the diabetic male rat.
Diabetes was induced in rats by i.v. injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg body weight). Diabetes was accompanied by infertility and atrophy of the male accessory glands. Blood glucose rose above 500 mg% (post prandial) and blood testosterone decreased to 14% of the level found in normoglycemic rats. Diabetes was followed by increased levels of sorbitol in the male accessory glands, prostate, seminal vesicle and coagulating gland, and in the eyes and sciatic nerves. Insulin treatment of the diabetic rats prevented sorbitol accumulation in the above tissues. AY 22, 284, and inhibitor of aldose reductase given in the food (1 g/kg body weight/day) for 3 weeks, did not prevent sorbitol accumulation in the organs mentioned. The changes in sorbitol metabolism in the diabetic rat and their possible involvement in male fertility are discussed.
