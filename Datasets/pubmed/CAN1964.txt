Further characterization of a thermosensitive transformation variant of mouse fibroblasts.
Temperature sensitive (ts) variants that express phenotype at low (33 degrees) but not at high (38.5 degrees) temperature were isolated from a mouse fibroblast strain C3H2K cells. Among these variants, cloned ts 12B cells showed at 38.5 degrees a density dependent inhibition of growth typical of normal fibroblasts cultured in vitro. However, at low temperature they lost this capacity and grew to a higher saturation density. The ts variant was also temperature sensitive as regards serum requirement: it required a higher concentration of serum for growth at 38.5 degrees than at 33 degrees. However, the cells behaved at both temperatures like the parent strain, possessing anchorage dependence for growth and fibronectin, whereas they were like transformed cells with respect to release of high fibrinolytic activity. No type C virus core protein p30 was detected at either temperature. Thus, various parameters of transformation in vitro were independently regulated in these variant cells.
