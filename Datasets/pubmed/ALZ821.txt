Immunological dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
Peripheral blood lymphocytes from Alzheimer's patients and apparently healthy elderly individuals were examined for interleukin 1 (IL 1) production. Our results indicate severely low production of IL 1 by patient's peripheral blood monocytes. The low production of IL 1 in vitro correlated with patients' symptoms and therapy with 1 acetamide,2 pyrrolidone (1a,2p). In addition to low IL 1 production, the number of autologous rosette forming cells (ARFC) was significantly decreased in all Alzheimer's patients whereas B cell glucose metabolism was significantly higher than age matched healthy individuals.
