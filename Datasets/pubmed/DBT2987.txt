Relationship between clinical and electrophysiological findings and indicators of heavy exposure to 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo dioxin.
In this study the prevalence rate of peripheral neuropathy in a population living in an area polluted with 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo dioxin (dioxin TCDD) was determined. Of the 723 subjects invited to the first screening in 1977, 470 (65%) attended. At the second screening in 1978, of the 710 invited subjects, 319 (45%) attended. Prevalence rate ratios for peripheral neuropathy and the associated 95% confidence limits were calculated for subgroups determined by the presence of (i) predisposing factors to neuropathy (alcoholism, diabetes, occupational exposure to neurotoxic agents, etc) or (ii) conditions thought to result from exposure to dioxin TCDD such as chloracne or abnormal serum hepatic enzyme levels. The prevalence rate of peripheral neuropathy among those subjects with predisposing factors and among those with chloracne or abnormal serum hepatic enzyme levels was nearly three times greater than among those without these manifestations. The results derived from this study may be useful qualitative pointers for identifying subjects at risk in the neurological follow up.
