Correlation between form and progression of diabetic preretinitis (author's transl).
Ninety three patients with typical symptoms of diabetic preretinitis were kept under observation for three to five years (on average 3.9 years), and examined by fluorescein angiography at least once a year. The progress of the various individual symptoms, such as capillary occlusions, pigment extravasation from small vessels, microaneurysms and AV shunts was statistically significant in patients suffering from a predominantly occlusive form of diabetic preretinitis. Hence, more rapid progression of changes must be expected in such patients thn in those suffering from exudative forms.
