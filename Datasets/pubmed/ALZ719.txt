CSF beta endorphin and beta lipotropin in Alzheimer's disease and multi infarct dementia.
We measured CSF levels of the opioid peptides beta endorphin and beta lipotropin  in patients with Alzheimer's disease, multi infarct dementia and controls. In both dementia groups, the mean concentration of beta endorphin was significantly lower than in controls. The mean beta lipotropin levels did not differ significantly in the two groups. The low CSF beta endorphin level may relate generally to dementia.
