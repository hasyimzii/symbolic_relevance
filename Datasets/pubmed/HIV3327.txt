Evaluation of target cells for HIV 1 specific antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays.
The T cell line, CEM E5, acutely and chronically infected with HIV 1, was used as a target cell in a standard 51Cr release HIV 1 specific antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. CEM E5, acutely infected with HIV 1, showed peak sensitivity to lysis in an HIV 1 specific ADCC assay on day 9 after infection. CEM E5 clones, chronically infected with HIV 1, that productively express the virus were better ADCC targets than infected clones that do not express HIV 1. One clone, C5D7, was identified which was particularly sensitive to lysis in the ADCC assay. This cell line grows continually and is stable in culture and appears to be the best target for HIV 1 specific ADCC in our system.
