Adrenal cortex glucocorticoid function in the early stages of the development of different forms of diabetes mellitus.
An increase in the basal cortisol level in the blood plasma or the adrenal cortex reaction to insulin hypoglycemia was seen in patients in the early periods of diabetes mellitus (latent, initial manifest type). No considerable differences were found between the adrenals of juvenile and adult diabetic patients. Combined diabetes mellitus and obesity led to a significant rise in the indices studied. An intensification of the adrenocortical glucocorticoid function is not accompanied by an enhancement of the hypophysis adrenocorticotropic function.
