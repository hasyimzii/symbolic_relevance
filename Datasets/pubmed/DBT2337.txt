IgG heavy chain allotypes (Gm) in autoimmune diseases.
Serum samples from 100 patients with myasthenia gravis, 322 with Graves' disease, 113 with Hashimoto's disease, 132 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 192 with insulin dependent juvenile diabetes mellitus, 83 with Behcet's syndrome, 73 with psoriasis vulgaris, 258 with leprosy, 112 with Duchenne progressive muscular dystrophy and 343 non related normal controls were studied for Gm allotypes. The incidence of Gm phenotypes with Gm(2) was significantly increased in patients with myasthenia gravis. Graves' disease, Hashimoto's disease, and high in SLE patients. The Gm1,2,21 haplotype was increased in patients with myasthenia gravis (chi 2 = 34 . 08, corrected P less than 0 . 001), Hashimoto's disease (chi 2 = 12 . 39, corrected P less than 0 . 05), Graves' disease (chi 2 = 8 . 65, corrected P less than 0 . 05), and SLE (chi 2 = 6 . 41, 0 . 1 greater than corrected P greater than 0 . 05). The total chi square for the four different Gm haplotypes was significantly increased in patients with myasthenia gravis (chi 2 = 44 . 46, corrected P less than 0 . 001), SLE (chi 2 = 20 . 70, corrected P less than 0 . 005), Hashimoto's disease (chi 2 = 17 . 03, corrected P less than 0 . 025), and Graves' disease (chi 2 = 11 . 87, corrected P less than 0 . 025). Our data suggest the presence of Gm associated pathogenic polygenes in certain autoimmune disorders.
