The NF kappa B binding sites in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat are not required for virus infectivity.
Mutations were introduced into the regulatory sequences in the long terminal repeat of an infectious molecular clone of the human immunodeficiency virus. Viruses in which the NF kappa B binding sites were deleted or ones in which one or two Sp1 binding sites were mutated still replicated efficiently in human T lymphocytes. A deletion of the two NF kappa B sites plus the three Sp1 sites or a mutation of the tat responsive region rendered the virus replication incompetent. Thus, the NF kappa B sequences are not required for human immunodeficiency virus infectivity; however, a tat responsive region is essential.
