A pressure lowering effect of retinal xenon photocoagulation in normotensive diabetic eyes.
In 10 diabetic patients with normal intraocular pressures, the effect of monocular panretinal xenon photocoagulation was recorded with the applanating suction cup tonograph applied bilaterally. One month after the treatment, the photocoagulated eyes showed an average decrease in pressure of approximately 3 mmHg, which was statistically significant (P < 0.001) when compared to the untreated fellow eye. On a percentage basis the falls were of a similar magnitude (approximately 25%) as those observed by others after photocoagulation in neovascular glaucoma.
