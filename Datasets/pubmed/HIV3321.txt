Synthesis of phosphorothioate analogues of oligodeoxyribonucleotides and their antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Nuclease resistant phosphorothioate analogues of oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos) were synthesized by sulfurization of either internucleoside phosphite linkages, in a repetitive manner during chain extension, or internucleoside hydrogen phosphonate linkages, in a single step following chain assembly. These analogues were tested as antiviral agents against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In a cytopathic effect inhibition assay using HIV uninfected susceptible T cells (tetanus toxoid specific normal T cells) co cultured with irradiated chronically HIV infected cells, phosphorothioate oligomers inhibited the cytopathic effect and replication of several isolates of HIV 1 and HIV 2. Thus phosphorothioate analogues of oligos could inhibit cell to cell transmission of the virus as well as the infection by cell free virus particles and also could inhibit a variety of isolates of human retroviruses.
