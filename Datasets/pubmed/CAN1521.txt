Variations of plasma CEA levels in gynecologic malignancies: incidence, significance and changes occurring in response to therapy.
Serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) radioimmunoassay were performed on 84 patients with primary gynecologic malignancies using the double antibody method. A positive correlation between the marker levels and tumor stage was found in the subjects with invasive disease: the incidence of positive values is appreciably higher in the advanced stages of malignancies. The surgical resection normalized the pretreatment elevated levels: fluctuating CEA values were observed during chemio or radiotherapy. The findings of this investigation support the theory of the limited usefulness of the CEA levels as a diagnostic test in patients with gynecologic cancer. The determination would appear to be helpful only in case with an elevated plasma values at the time of diagnosis. The CEA test seems to indicate that serial plasma assays can be of large interest in the follow up of this women and for the second look surgery, chemio and radiant therapy.
