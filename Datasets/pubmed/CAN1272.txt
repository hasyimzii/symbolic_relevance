Growth inhibition of mouse mammary tumor cells by dexamethasone concurrent with enhanced endogenous protein phosphorylation: effects of retinoic acid.
Exposure of Mm 5mt mouse mammary tumor cells to either dexamethasone, retinoic acid or both drugs, results in growth inhibition of the cultures, as compared with controls. Endogenous protein phosphorylation using gamma 32P ATP revealed prominent labelling mainly in the 58K region in extracts from retinoic acid treated and control cultures. Extracts from dexamethasone treated cultures showed phosphorylation in the 58K, 53K, 47K and 27K regions. Exposure to both drugs gave extracts showing labelling in the 60K and 65K regions in addition to the bands phosphorylated in extracts exposed only to the steroid, concurrent with an even more marked inhibition of growth.
