Evaluation of leukocyte migration inhibition (LIF) in patients with carcinoma of the lung before and after the use of levamisole in vitro.
Aspecific immunosuppression in neoplasia has long been known, even though all its biological aspects are not yet fully understood. Inhibition of leukocyte migration (LIF) was studied before and after the use of levamisole in vitro to determine whether changes occurred in cell reactivity. The results of the investigation are discussed in the light of modern immunopathological theories.
