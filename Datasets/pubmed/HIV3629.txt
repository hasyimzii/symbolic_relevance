Human monoclonal antibodies to HIV 1: cross reactions with gag and env products.
Human monoclonal antibodies were raised by in vitro immunization of normal human  spleen cells with denatured HIV 1 and subsequent fusion to an Epstein Barr virus (EBV) transformed cell line. Three monoclonals reacted with both gag encoded p24 core protein and env encoded gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein. The cross reaction was confirmed by reactivity with p24  and gp41 derived recombinant peptides. The peptides share two amino acid sequences which may be the basis for the cross reaction. Attempted epitope mapping using synthetic peptides was unsuccessful due to non specific reactivity with the short linear peptides.
