Animal models of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Public Health Service Animal Models Committee.
The search for a model of HIV infection continues. While much of the initial work focussed on animal models of AIDS, more recent efforts have sought animal models of HIV infection in which one or more signs of AIDS may be reproduced. Most initial small animal modelling efforts were negative and many such efforts remain unpublished. In 1988, the Public Health Service (PHS) AIDS Animal Model Committee conducted a survey among PHS agencies to identify published and unpublished data on animal models of HIV. To date, the chimpanzee is the only animal to be reliably infected with HIV albeit without development of signs and symptoms normally associated with human AIDS. One recent study has shown the gibbon to be similarly susceptible to infection with HIV. Mice carrying a chimera of elements of the human immune system have been shown to support the growth of HIV and F1 progeny of transgenic mice containing intact copies of HIV proviral DNA, have developed a disease that resembles some aspects of human AIDS. Rabbits, baboons and rhesus monkeys have also been shown to be infected under certain conditions and/or with selected strains of HIV but again without the development of AIDS symptomatology. This report briefly summarizes published and available unpublished data on these efforts to develop an animal model of HIV infection.
