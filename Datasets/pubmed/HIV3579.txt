Biloma secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma in an HIV seropositive patient.
Biloma has been defined as an extraductular collection of bile within a defined capsular space. Prior reports have documented an association of biloma with abdominal trauma and abdominal surgery. Biloma has not been reported in association with or as the presenting manifestation of hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, hepatocellular carcinoma has not been previously reported in an HIV seropositive patient. We present the case of an HIV seropositive patient with hepatocellular carcinoma complicated by a biloma.
