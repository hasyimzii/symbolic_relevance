Effect of carbostimulin on biosynthetic processes in rabbits with alloxan diabetes.
In rabbits with alloxane diabetes the intensity of [I 14C] glycine label incorporation into various tissue components is considerably lowered. Stimulation of carboxylation in animals under these conditions intensifies the label incorporation into proteins of the liver, kidneys, spleen as well as into blood serum albumin and globulin. The level of lipids, glycogen in the liver, the total content of proteins in blood serum and their specific radioactivity increase. All this evidences for intensification of biosynthetic processes and for a possibility to normalize the metabolism with diabetes by stimulating the processes of carboxylation.
