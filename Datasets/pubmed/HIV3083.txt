Immunosuppression in homosexual men seronegative for HTLV III.
Clinical, microbiological, and lifestyle patterns in homosexual men showing in vitro immunological abnormalities were studied and related to the susceptibility to human T lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III) infection. In a cohort of male homosexual volunteers in Finland, 90% were HTLV III antibody negative. Ten % of the HTLV III negative cases showed decreased T helper/suppressor cell ratios, mostly due to elevated numbers of T suppressor cells. In this immunosuppressed group, more signs of diarrhea, intestinal giardiasis, genital warts, and hepatitis B were observed than in the other HTLV III antibody negative study subjects. The type of sexual practice was not associated with the in vitro immune abnormalities. During a follow up of up to 16 months, 4 initially HTLV III antibody negative cases showed seroconversion. Three of these had inverted T helper/suppressor cell ratios prior to the seroconversion. It is concluded that persons showing in vitro immunosuppression are more susceptible to HTLV III infection when being exposed to the virus or else alteration in T cell subsets signals a pre antibody positive or early phase of HTLV III infection.
