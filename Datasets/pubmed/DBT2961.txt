The influence of genetic background on the expression of mutations at the diabetes locus in the mouse. III. Effect of H 2 haplotype and sex.
The expression of the mouse mutation, diabetes (db), was examined on eight different inbred genetic backgrounds. The influence of H 2 haplotype and sex was examined. Mice of both sexes in two diabetes (db) strains (C57BL/6J, 129/J) having the H 2b haplotype were resistant to the diabetogenic action of the mutant gene. On the contrary, two H 2d congenic diabetes stocks (C57BL/KsJ, DBA/2J) exhibited severe diabetes associated with beta cell necrosis. However, diabetes resistance was not restricted to mice with H 2b haplotype since the congenic diabetes MA/J stock (H 2k) was also resistant. Similarly, diabetes susceptibility was not restricted to mice with the H 2d haplotype, since males, but generally not females, in the congenic CBA/Lt db/db and C3HeB/FeJ db/db stocks (both H 2k) also exhibited a severe diabetes. Males of the congenic SWR/J db stock (H 2q) had a diabetes of intermediate severity. Female diabetes mice with H 2k and H 2q haplotypes exhibited a sustained hypertrophy and hyperplasia of beta cells and were able to control hyperglycemia better than males. Thus, while the H 2b haplotype remains associated with resistance, and the H 2d haplotype with susceptibility to induction of genetic diabetes, the diabetes stocks with H 2k haplotype clearly illustrate the importance of non H 2, but sex associated, genetic modifiers.
