Immunoenzymatic localization of prolactin like immunoreactivity in decidual cells of the endometrium from pregnant and nonpregnant women.
Prolactin like immunoreactivity has been localized by an immunoenzymatic method in the decidual cells of the endometrium in cases of early (10 weeks) normal pregnancy, (12 weeks) molar pregnancy, (8  10 weeks) tubal pregnancy, and of a nonpregnant woman under progestogen (lynestrenol) treatment. A specific endocrine influence, predominantly progestogenic, rather than the implantation of trophoblastic tissue seems to be required for the appearance of prolactin like immunoreactivity in the decidual cells of the endometrium.
