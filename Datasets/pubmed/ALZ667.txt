Treatment of Alzheimer's disease with a synthetic ACTH 4 9 analog.
The synthetic ACTH 4 9 analog, Org 2766, was administered to 77 Alzheimer's patients for 6 months in a double blind, placebo controlled study. Although Org 2766 was tolerated well, no significant effect of Org 2766 could be demonstrated in terms of rating scales or cognitive functions.
