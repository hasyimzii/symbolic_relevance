Bone marrow examination in patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC). Morphologic and in situ hybridization studies.
Bone marrow examinations were performed on 20 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 39 with AIDS related complex (ARC). Fever of unknown origin and thrombocytopenia were common in ARC, but anemia and leukopenia were most frequent in AIDS. Changes in stromal cells and perivascular cuffing of plasma cells were found significantly more often in patients with AIDS than in those with ARC. Malignancies were common in both groups. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nucleic acids were detected with the use of a 3H labeled cDNA probe with an in situ hybridization method in 11 bone marrow samples (three ARC and eight AIDS). Most commonly positive cells were mononucleated, resembling lymphocytes and histiocytes. Endothelial cells, interdigitating reticulum cells, nucleated red blood cells, and immature myeloid cells also had positive results in some instances. The number of HIV positive cells was not related to the size of the bone biopsies or the clinical diagnoses. The authors postulate that changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of these patients may be related to latent persistent infection with HIV.
