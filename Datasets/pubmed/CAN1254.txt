Regulation of integrated adenovirus sequences during adenovirus infection of transformed cells.
A human cell line (293) transformed by adenovirus type 5 encodes mRNA's and proteins from the early region 1 (E1) of the viral genome. These products correspond to those synthesized early after adenovirus infection of normal cells. This pattern of expression is different from that observed at later times in the lytic cycle. We have determined whether integrated sequences can undergo the early late transition during infection of transformed cells. Cultures of 293 cells were infected with mutants of adenovirus type 5 that have deletions in EI genes. In such infections, the integrated sequence complements the deletion mutants so that viral DNA replication, late mRNA and protein synthesis, and viral assembly occur. Because the infecting genomes lack EI sequences, the products synthesized from the integrated DNA could be analyzed. In contrast to the early late transition that occurs with EI DNA in free viral genomes, the pattern of mRNAs and proteins made from the integrated sequences was restricted to the early pattern. Assuming that the viral sequences in 293 cells have not become altered during the history of the cells, our results suggest that regulation of integrated adenovirus genes may not be determined exclusively by nucleotide sequence recognition. Apparently, during infection certain factors prevent the integrated viral genes from responding to the regulatory signals which control late expression from free EI DNA. The distinction between integrated and free viral sequences might reflect the different fates of viral and host transcripts during the lytic cycle of adenovirus.
