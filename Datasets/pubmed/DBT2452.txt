Myocardial extraction of nonesterified fatty acids and ketone bodies and their relationship normally and in experimental diabetes mellitus.
It was established in experiments on 20 dogs with diabetes mellitus and 14 control animals that the relationships between glucose insulin and non esterified fatty acids ketone bodies (NEKB) change in the course of diabetes mellitus development. The study of myocardial extraction of NEKB and ketone bodies has shown an increase in their consumption by the myocardium in diabetes mellitus. Intensification of myocardial extraction of ketone bodies was stipulated by elevation of their concentration in the arterial blood and by activation of appropriate enzymes participating in their metabolism. An enhancement of NEKB myocardial consumption seems likely to be due to activation of the appropriate enzymes promoting their utilization.
