Survey of AIDS knowledge and behavior changes among Massachusetts adults.
In October 1987, 1,323 Massachusetts residents were randomly interviewed by telephone to explore their exposure to AIDS educational efforts, levels of knowledge about AIDS, and whether that knowledge modified their behavior. Gay/bisexual males, iv drug users and heterosexual respondents were compared as were blacks, Hispanics, and whites. While 81% of respondents had read or heard mass media stories about AIDS, in the previous week, only 5% had ever been counseled about AIDS by a physician. Over 97% of black (N = 152) and white respondents (N = 1,057), as well as gay/bisexual males (N = 21) and iv drug users (N = 33) were aware that HIV can be transmitted by homosexual or heterosexual intercourse and by sharing needles when injecting drugs. However, 9% of the 55 Hispanics interviewed were unaware of male homosexual transmission, and 7% did not know about heterosexual transmission or the risks of needle sharing. Twenty percent of Hispanics, compared with 9% of other respondents, did not know HIV can be transmitted sexually by someone who appears healthy. Fifty two percent of gay/bisexual males, 27% of iv drug users, and 21% of those who had multiple heterosexual partners in recent years reported adopting abstinence, monogamous relations, or condom use to avoid HIV exposure. Those who continued risky behavior were just as knowledgeable about HIV transmission, but they were less likely to report that they worry a great deal about getting AIDS, 14% vs 32%. The results indicate that new strategies and resources are needed to educate Hispanics. Physicians need to counsel more persons about HIV transmission and further efforts are needed to translate knowledge about HIV transmission into behavior change to avoid the virus.
