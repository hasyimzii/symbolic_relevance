Diabetic nephropathy. Review of the current status and practical considerations  concerning etiopathogenetic, clinical and therapeutic aspects.
Reference is made to personal research and clinical experience, coupled with a select bibliography, in a survey of the most significant current knowledge with regard to diabetic nephropathy, designed for the nonspecialist practitioner and intended to enable him to update his knowledge without plunging into details, and to quickly decide what measures he should adopt in his daily practice. Questions of histopathology and aetiopathogenesis are examined, together with the relations between proteinuria, hypertension, renal function, and diabetic nephropathy. The clinical profile and progress of the disease are illustrated. Lastly, an account is given of the conventional modes of treatment, and of the still partly unsatisfactory results offered by more recent forms of replacement therapy (dialysis and transplantation).
