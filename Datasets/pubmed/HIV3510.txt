Diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive children.
Twelve children with laboratory evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection underwent diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy with washings or bronchoalveolar lavage at Bellevue Hospital Center from October 1987 to April 1989. The patients included 7 boys and 5 girls ranging from age 3.5 months to 10 years 5 months. Indications for bronchoscopy included respiratory distress with or without focal changes on chest radiograph in 11 patients, and persistent but asymptomatic right middle lobe collapse in one child. The etiology of pneumonia was diagnosed in 7 children and included Pneumocystis carinii, (PCP) (17%), Streptococcus viridans (17%), mechanical obstruction (17%) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (8%). Bronchoscopy was non diagnostic in 5 cases. Techniques for maximal yield of information using flexible bronchoscopy in HIV positive children are discussed.
