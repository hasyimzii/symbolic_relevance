Androgen regulation in patients with diabetic retinopathy.
In 21 male diabetics (juvenile onset diabetes) with diabetic retinopathy and 13 patients without this condition, the HCG and the LH RH stimulation tests were performed and the results compared to those of 20 persons with normal metabolism and full vision. The findings can be interpreted as hypothalamic hypophysogonadal dysregulation in case of lowered basal testosterone, significantly inverse correlation to the relative responsiveness of Leydig's cells, lacking correlation between LH and testosterone as well as normal LH RH test. Differences between patients with and without retinopathy were not detectable.
