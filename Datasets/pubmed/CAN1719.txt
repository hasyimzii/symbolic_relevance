Phase 2 study with cis dichlorodiaminoplatinum (II) in advanced solid tumors.
cis Dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) was administered in 23 patients with far advanced solid malignancies using a dose schedule of 50 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. All patients previously had progressive disease using conventional cytotoxic therapies. More than 50% of the patients had been pretreated with at least four different drugs, 9 patients had additionally been irradiated. IN 4 patients there was objective tumor regression (duration 1 4 months); in 7 patients tumor progression could be stopped for at least 1 month; 12 patients did not respond. By sufficient fluid administration combined with electrolyte substitution, furosemide and mannitol, no severe toxic side effects were encountered.
