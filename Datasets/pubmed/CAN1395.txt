The effect of hyperthermia on vascular function, pH, and cell survival.
Blood flow in rat skin and muscle increased three  to fourfold during heating at  43 degrees C for one hour, while that in Walker tumors did not change significantly; however, blood flow in the tumors decreased a few hours after heating at 45 degrees C. The temperature of Walker tumors was significantly higher than in the muscle during heating, probably due to inefficient heat dissipation caused by the sluggish blood flow. Severe vascular occlusion occurred in SCK tumors in mice after heating at 41.5 45.0 degrees C. Upon heating, the pH in the tumors significantly decreased, while that in the muscle increased. The clonogenic cell number continuously decreased when SCK tumors were left in situ after hyperthermia. The vascular occlusion and increase in acidity may account for the progressive death of tumor cells after heating.
