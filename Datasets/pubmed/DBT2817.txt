Prevalence of diabetes among children of insulin dependent diabetic mothers.
Eight diabetics were found among 464 children, mean age 11.2 years, of 311 unselected insulin treated mothers. By a method of age correction the total diabetes prevalence among the children at the age of 25 years was calculated as 3.4%. Three children were non insulin dependent and these patients and their mothers may belong to the autosomal dominant type of diabetes, so called MODY. In two of the other five families the fathers also had insulin dependent diabetes; in two more cases first or second degree paternal relatives were insulin dependent diabetics. Thus the prevalence of insulin dependent diabetes among the children of insulin dependent mothers married to non diabetics is calculated as 1.5% at the age of 25 years.
