Potent and selective anti HTLV III/LAV activity of 2',3' dideoxycytidinene, the 2',3' unsaturated derivative of 2',3' dideoxycytidine.
2',3' Dideoxycytidinene (ddeCyd), the 2',3' unsaturated derivative of 2',3' dideoxycytidine (ddCyd) is, like ddCyd itself, a potent and selective inhibitor of HTLV III/LAV in vitro. This conclusion is based on the relatively high ratio of effective antiviral dose (0.3 microM) versus cell growth inhibitory concentration (20 35 microM) and the lack of any appreciable inhibitory activity against a series of non oncogenic RNA and DNA viruses. Both compounds were considerably more inhibitory to human lymphoid cell lines than human nonlymphoid or murine cell lines. They were highly dependent on prior activation by deoxycytidine kinase to exert their anti HTLV III/LAV and cytostatic effects. In contrast with ddCyd, ddeCyd lost part of its anti retrovirus effect upon prolonged incubation (10 days) with the virus infected cells in culture.
