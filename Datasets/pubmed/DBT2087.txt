Changes in the phospholipid spectrum and activity of certain phosphatide synthesis enzyme systems in the brain and liver of rats with alloxan diabetes.
The experiments on brain and liver tissues of rats with alloxan diabetes have shown significant changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of phospholipids. In the test tissues there was a pronounced inhibition of glycerokinase. It is of interest to note that the activity of L alpha glycerophosphate dehydrogenase varies in direct and reverse reactions.
