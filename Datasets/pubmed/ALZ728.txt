Cluster analysis of cognitive performance in elderly and demented subjects.
48 elderly normals, 14 demented subjects and 76 young controls were tested for basic cognitive functions. All the tests were quantified and could therefore be subjected to statistical analysis. The results show a difference in the speed of information processing and in memory load between the young controls and elderly normals but the age groups differed in quantitative terms only. Cluster analysis showed that the elderly and the demented formed two distinctly separate groups at the qualitative level, the basic cognitive processes being damaged in the demented group. Age thus appears to be only a risk factor for dementia and not its cause. It is concluded that batteries based on precise and measurable tasks are the most appropriate not only for the study of dementia but for rehabilitation purposes too.
