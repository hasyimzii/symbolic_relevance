A study on the correlation between immune responses and histopathological changes of primary lesion in patients with cervical cancer following radiation therapy (author's transl).
From an immunological viewpoint, histological changes of stromal cell reactions and regional lymph nodes were observed in uterine cervical cancer patients who received test irradiation. Delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction, peripheral lymphocyte blastoid transformation, and peripheral lymphocyte subpopulations were also studied. 1) The variation of stromal reaction after test irradiation was analogous to that of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity. 2) There was a significant correlation between the degree of stromal reaction and skin reactivity to PPD and PHA. Stromal reaction increased in proportion to PPD skin reactivity after test irradiation. 3) The degree of stromal reaction was not correlated with the ability of lymphocyte blastoid transformation and peripheral T lymphocyte counts. 4) The prognosis was good in the cases that showed marked stromal reaction and greater enlargement of the regional lymph nodes. 5) The radiosensitivity score was correlated to PPD skin reactivity. From these observations, it was presumed that the host immunity had an effect on the curative course of uterine cervical cancer and stromal reaction was one of the histological parameters that demonstrated immune reactions.
