Transient hypoglycemia following 25 hydroxycholecalciferol administraton to mice.
A transient hypoglycemia was found 4 hrs after injection of 25 hydroxycholecalciferol (25 HCC) in mice. This was not associated with any significant alteration in the serum insulin concentration, suggesting that the hypoglycemic response is due to extrapancreatic factors. Pretreatment with 25 HCC did not affect the development of alloxan diabetes.
