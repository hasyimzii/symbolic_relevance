Disorders of the nervous system associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinical approach.
The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and characterized by disorders of the nervous system in addition to opportunistic infection and cancer. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend the classification system consisting of four major groups. Group I is patients with acute HIV infection, and Group II is asymptomatic carriers. Group III is those with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL). Group IV includes five subgroups: IVA with constitutional disease, IVB with neurologic disease, IVC with secondary infectious diseases, IVD with secondary cancers and IVE with other conditions. The nervous system disorders are classified into two types: one is produced by HIV itself and not directly related to immunodeficiency, and the other caused by opportunistic infectious agents and cancers. The former is further divided into two kinds: atypical aseptic meningitis and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) occur mainly in Group I and II, whereas HIV encephalopathy, distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) and vacuolar myelopathy in Group III and IV. Group I or II patients have no apparent medical problems. Therefore, when neurologists see patients with risk factors for HIV infection presenting with atypical meningitis or AIDP, it is of utmost importance to have a high index of suspicion and to look for evidence of HIV infection.
