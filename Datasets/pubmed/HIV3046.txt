Intra blood brain barrier synthesis of HTLV III specific IgG in patients with neurologic symptoms associated with AIDS or AIDS related complex.
Intra blood brain barrier production of virus specific antibody is good evidence  of infection within the blood brain barrier. Patients with the acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have an increased incidence of neurologic abnormalities  i.e., unexplained, diffuse encephalopathy manifested clinically as chronic progressive dementia. To define the role of human T cell lymphotropic virus Type III (HTLV III), the etiologic agent of AIDS, in the pathogenesis of neurologic dysfunction, we compared cerebrospinal fluid and serum from patients with neurologic symptoms associated with AIDS and the AIDS related complex for the presence of antibodies directed against HTLV III. Antibodies directed against HTLV III antigens were detected by four immunologic tests: a fixed cell immunofluorescence assay, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblots of viral lysates, and immunoprecipitation of cellular lysates. All patients were seropositive, and 22 of 23 (96 per cent) had HTLV III specific antibodies in their cerebrospinal fluid. Unique oligoclonal IgG bands were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the rate of IgG synthesis within the blood brain barrier was elevated. In eight of nine patients tested, the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay showed that the percentage of HTLV III specific IgG in cerebrospinal fluid was higher than in serum, suggesting that HTLV III infection of neurologic tissue occurs in the majority of patients with neurologic disease associated with AIDS or its related complex.
