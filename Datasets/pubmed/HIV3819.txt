Liposomes modulate human immunodeficiency virus infectivity.
We have investigated the effects of the fusion of liposomes with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1LVA) on the ability of the virus to infect CD4+ and CD4  cells. Fluorescence dequenching measurements indicated that HIV 1 fuses with liposomes composed of either cardiolipin (CL) or N [2,3 (dioleyloxy) propyl] N,N,N trimethyl ammonium chloride (DOTMA) but not appreciably with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) liposomes. Pre incubation of HIV 1 with DOTMA liposomes enhanced virus production (measured by p24 gag antigen production in the culture medium and in situ) in CD4+ A3.01 and H9 cells in a concentration dependent manner, but did not mediate the infection of the CD4  cell line, K562. Preincubation of HIV 1 with between 10 and 30 microM DOTMA liposomes, and subsequent incubation with A3.01 cells, resulted in the production of about 30 fold greater levels of virus than controls. The presence of DOTMA liposomes during the incubation of A3.01 cells with HIV 1 enhanced the infectivity of the virus up to 90 fold compared to controls. Conversely, preincubation of HIV 1 with CL liposomes inhibited infection of A3.01 cells, dependent on the concentration of liposomes; DOPC liposomes did not alter the infectivity of the virus under any of the incubation conditions. Our results thus indicate that fusion of HIV 1 with liposomes alters the ability of the virus to infect its target cells.
