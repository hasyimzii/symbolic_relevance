Quantification of a number of biogenic amines and their metabolites in brain homogenates by gas chromatography  mass spectrometry.
A sensitive method is described for the assay of various biogenic amines and their metabolites from brain tissue homogenates. Based on gas chromatography mass spectrometry and selected ion monitoring, the method allows reliable low level quantification of the compounds of interest. By careful study of reaction conditions both in the preparation of derivatives for gas chromatography and in the synthesis of deuterated analogues for internal standard use, relatively simple procedures could be applied with good analytical efficiency. Correlation of the results with those obtained by a high performance liquid chromatographic procedure was also investigated, and a neurologic application of the method is briefly discussed.
