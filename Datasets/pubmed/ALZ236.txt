Down's syndrome as a model disease.
Aneuploid chromosomal disorders may offer insight into the pathogenesis of certain common diseases. The birth defects and mental retardation that characterize Down's syndrome are well recognized. In addition, the altered chromosomal content that occurs in the syndrome apparently affects the prevalence of a variety of disorders, such as malignancy, endocrine dysfunction, infection, atherosclerosis, and premature aging. Because the single distinguishing factor in Down's syndrome is the presence of an excess of a part of chromosome 21, the genetic information contained in this chromosomal segment seems to be responsible for the disease manifestations. Techniques of somatic cell genetics and molecular biology allow mapping of human genes and study of their expression. With such methods it should be possible to understand Down's syndrome and other aneuploid disorders and to apply these considerations to other areas of medicine.
