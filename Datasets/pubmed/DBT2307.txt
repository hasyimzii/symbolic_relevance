Cerebral ischemia in young adults.
56 cerebral ischemia patients up to the age of 40 were investigated using a strict clinical and instrumental protocol in order to elicit the relative importance of the various iatrogenic factors involved. In addition to atherosclerosis risk factors (smoking, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia) other possible causes of cerebral ischemia were sought (arteritis, migraine, head injury, oral contraceptives, coagulation disorders, cardiogenic embolism, etc.). 50% of the patients examined had at least two atherosclerosis risk factors and 55% had other causes singly or in association with atherosclerosis.
