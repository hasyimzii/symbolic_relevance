Fluorophotometry. II. Streptozocin treated guinea pigs.
Normal and streptozocin treated guinea pigs were examined with a fluorophotometer one hour after receiving an intravenous injection of fluorescein sodium. The level of fluorescence in the vitreous was significantly greater in animals showing marked glucosuria than in normal animals or those showing little glucosuria. The excessive fluorescence of the vitreous is similar to that reported by others in diabetic humans and rats but is found in the guinea pig, an animal known normally to have no retinal vasculature.
