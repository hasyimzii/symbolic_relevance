Plasma angiotensin II and the control of diabetes mellitus.
Plasma angiotensin II was measured in twenty patients with poorly controlled non ketotic diabetes mellitus, and again when blood glucose control improved. Plasma angiotensin II fell significantly improved control, both when patients were supine and fasting overnight, and when studied after 4 h ambulation. The change occurred with improved short term and longer term control. It is concluded that the degree of blood glucose control is important when assessing the renin angiotensin system in diabetic patients.
