Event related potential in Alzheimer disease.
Auditory event   related potentials were studied in 20 patients with SDAT and 20  age and sex matched normal controls. Patients with SDAT showed prolonged latencies of N200 and P300 components. The mean amplitudes of N200 and P300 were lower in the SDAT group. This reflects the impairment of the speed of neural processing in patients with SDAT. There were no significant correlations of the progression of P300 latencies from mild to severe dementia according to global dementia scales.
