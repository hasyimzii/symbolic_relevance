A case of polyorchidism with testicular teratoma.
A patient with duplication of the testis who presented initially with torsion of  a right inguinal testis is described. Subsequently, a malignant teratoma of the trophoblastic type (choriocarcinoma) developed in the scortal testis on the right side. This scrotal testis was impalpable initially but a normal testis was present on the left side. The patient died of cerebral and pulmonary metastases of the teratoma.
