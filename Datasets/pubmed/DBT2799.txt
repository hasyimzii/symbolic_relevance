Computed tomography in acute pyelonephritis associated with diabetes.
The computed tomographic (CT) findings in four diabetic patients with gram negative pyelonephritis are described. Excretory urography with tomography was performed in three patients, with normal results. Linear areas of low denisty which were observed on the CT scans corroborate previous reports, and the authors suggest that CT may be more sensitive than conventional techniques in the detection of infectious renal parenchymal disease.
