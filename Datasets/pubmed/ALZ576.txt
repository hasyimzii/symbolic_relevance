Neurotransmitter specific alterations in dementing disorders: insights from animal models.
Recent years have witnessed considerable change in the conceptualization of the pathophysiology of the cognitive impairments in dementing disorders, as a result of synaptic neurochemical analyses. Profound reductions in the forebrain cholinergic projections occur in Alzheimer's disease. In GM1 gangliosidosis, variable alterations in neurotransmitter related processes that are located in synaptic membranes have been described. Exploitation of animal models of human disorders resulting in dementia may further clarify the dynamic alterations in the biochemical processes required for effective neurotransmission in cortex.
