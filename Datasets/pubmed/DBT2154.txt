ECG study of diabetes mellitus patients at rest, in an orthostatic posture and under physical load.
ECG changes at rest were noted in half of 87 patients with diabetes mellitus. Negative ECG changes in orthostatics were observed in 2/3 of the patients. The rate of the changes depends upon the heart rate increase, reflecting higher sympathetico adrenal activity. The results of potassium salt application point to metabolic disorders in the myocardium of patients with diabetes mellitus. The orthostatic test performed during the course of treatment with potassium salt may serve as an index of efficiency and stability of the therapy conducted. ECG changes under physical exercise were observed in 14 of 54 patients, only in 4 of them the changes were tupical of coronary heart disease. Comparison of exercise tolerance, orthostatic and potassium salt tests which reveal cardiac damage of different nature, suggests that myocardial changes in patients with diabetes mellitus are mostly conditioned by the development of metabolic changes.
