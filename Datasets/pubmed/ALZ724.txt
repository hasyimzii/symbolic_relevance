Deficient repair of DNA lesions in Alzheimer's disease fibroblasts.
DNA strand breaks, resulting from treatment with N methyl N' nitro N nitrosoguanidine, were repaired more slowly in four strains of familial Alzheimer's disease fibroblasts than in five strains of fibroblasts from age matched normals. These results were not due to differences between the two cell types in in vitro ages, in the initial DNA damage or in drug induced cell lysis. Bleomycin induced DNA double strand breaks were repaired equally efficiently by both types of cells. Alzheimer's disease cells may have a DNA repair defect, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease.
