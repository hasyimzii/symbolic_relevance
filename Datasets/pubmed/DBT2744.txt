A reevaluation of the glucagon provocative test for pheochromocytoma  on the in  vitro release of catecholamine from the adrenal medulla or pheochromocytoma tissue, and on the effect of intravenous glucagon on urinary catecholamine excretion and blood pressure (author's transl).
The effects of glucagon on the adrenergic system have been studied in experimental and clinical conditions. 1. in vitro studies: In the first experiment a continuous flow incubation system was developed in which the secretory response to these drugs was characterized by a serial fluorimetric assay of catecholamines in the effluent medium. Pig adrenal medulla or human pheochromocytoma were studied. There was an initial massive release of catecholamines which declined to basal levels (0.02 micrograms/mg) after 1.5 hours. When 10( 4) glucagon was infused for 10 minutes following 2 hours of preincubation, both adrenaline and nonadrenaline outputs rose abruptly to concentrations of 0.08 micrograms/mg and 0.07 micrograms/mg respectively. In the second experiment the effect of these drugs on the in vitro release of catecholamines from the isolated in vitro chromaffin granules of the pig adrenal medulla were studied. The results were the same as in the previous experiment. 2. clinical studies: The effects of glucagon were studied on the blood pressure and urinary catecholamine levels of healthy control subjects, of patients suffering from essential hypertension, thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus and acromegaly. Glucagon induced a slight but constant increase in blood pressure. By contrast no significant urinary catecholaline elevation was evoked. There was no difference in the effect of intravenous glucagon between normal subjects and patients suffering from the above mentioned disorders.
