Surface properties of cells isolated from non metastasizing and metastasizing hamster lymphosarcomas.
Present evidence suggests that the cell surface has an important role in metastasis. To examine this idea further, the surface properties of single cells isolated from the primary growths of a liver metastasizing (ML) and a non metastasizing (NML) lymphosarcoma were compared for adhesion to cell monolayers, cytopherometry, isoelectric focusing, adhesion to immobilized lectins and surface labelling with lactoperoxidase catalysed radioiodination. It was found that the ML cells had increased adhesion to 3 out of 4 of the monolayers studies; a lower overall surface charge but greater peripheral concentrations of charge; and increased surface expression of the fucose moiety. No consistent difference between the two cell types was detected in the electrophoretic pattern of the labelled surface proteins. These findings are discussed in the light of present knowledge of the cell surface, and it is concluded that the significance of any of the observed changes in relation to metastasis has yet to be established.
