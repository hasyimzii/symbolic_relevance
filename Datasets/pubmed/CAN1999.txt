Effect of glucosamine on phenotype mixing of vesicular stomatitis virus with avian sarcoma virus.
The effect of glucosamine on phenotypic mixing between vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and avian sarcoma virus (ASV) was studied. Phenotypic mixing decreased with increase in glucosamine concentration, and, in the presence of 20 mM glucosamine, was no longer detectable. In the presence of 20 mM glucosamine, cells still produced 10(2)  10(3) focus forming units (FFU) of ASV and 10(6) plaque forming units (PFU) of VSV per milliliter. These results suggest that cells producing a relatively large amount of ASV (more than 10(3) FFU/ml) are essential for phenotypic mixing of VSV with ASV.
