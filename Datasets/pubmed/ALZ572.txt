Studies on neurotransmitter binding in senile dementia. Comparison of Alzheimer's and mixed vascular Alzheimer's dementias.
Binding of 3H labeled agonists and antagonists to muscarinic cholinergic, alpha   and beta adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, and opiate receptors was studied in four regions of the neocortex and in hippocampus, thalamus, putamen, and caudatus in autoptic material from patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type and of mixed vascular Alzheimer pathogenesis. Different patterns of changes in ligand binding were found for the two groups. Some of these changes were quantitatively correlated with the histological scores of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
