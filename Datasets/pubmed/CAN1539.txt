Metabolic fate of N butyl N (4 hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine in the rat.
The metabolic fate of N butyl N (4 hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) was studied in  the rat, to investigate the possibility of a relationship between urinary metabolites and organotropic carcinogenicity to the urinary bladder of this N nitrosamine. The principal urinary metabolite of BBN was identified as N butyl N (3 carboxypropyl)nitrosamine (BCPN). Several minor metabolites characterized were transformation products of BCPN formed by beta oxidation according to the Knoop mechanism, i.e., N butyl N (2 hydroxy 3 carboxy propyl)nitrosamine, N butyl N (carboxymethyl)nitrosamine and N butyl N (2 oxopropyl)nitrosamine; glucuronic acid conjugates of BBN and BCPN were also detected. No BBN was detected in the urine. A possible correlation of the urinary excretion of BCPN with selective induction of bladder tumors by BBN in rats is discussed in relation to the carcinogenic action of BCPN.
