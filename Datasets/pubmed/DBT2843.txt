Metabolic aspects of psoriasis: the basis for specific therapy.
Psoriasis, like diabetes, is a multifactorial genetic disease with complex interactions of deranged metabolism. Factors that affect epidermal differentiation and proliferation include cyclic nucleotide interactions, polyamine metabolism, cell surface  cytoskeleton interactions, and arachidonic acid  prostaglandin cascade. Evidence indicates that pharmacologic manipulation of the so called critical metabolic systems not only may help us to understand the pathophysiology of psoriasis but also may yield improved treatments for the disease.
