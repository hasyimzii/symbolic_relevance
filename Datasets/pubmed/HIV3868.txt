Generation of hybrid genes and proteins by vaccinia virus mediated recombination: application to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 env.
The ability of poxviruses to undergo intramolecular recombination within tandemly arranged homologous sequences can be used to generate chimeric genes and proteins. Genes containing regions of nucleotide homology will recombine to yield a single sequence composed of portions of both original genes. A recombinant virus containing two genes with a number of conserved regions will yield a population of recombinant viruses containing a spectrum of hybrid sequences derived by recombination between the original genes. This scheme has been used to generate hybrid human immunodeficiency virus type 1 env genes. Recombinant vaccinia viruses that contain two divergent env genes in tandem array have been constructed. In the absence of selective pressure to maintain both genes, recombination between conserved homologous regions in these genes generated a wide range of progeny, each of which expressed a novel variant polypeptide encoded by the newly created hybrid env gene. Poxvirus mediated recombination may be applied to map type specific epitopes, to create novel pharmaceuticals such as hybrid interferons, to study receptor binding or enzyme substrate specificities, or to mimic the antigenic diversity found in numerous pathogens.
