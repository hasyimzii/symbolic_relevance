Lithium induced increases in red blood cell choline and memory performance in Alzheimer type dementia.
To investigate the relationship between RBC choline and memory in Alzheimer type  senile dementia (SDAT), lithium carbonate was administered to 14 SDAT patients in doses of 400 600 mg/day for 5 weeks. A battery of memory tests was administered at baseline and at weekly intervals. Five patients with serum concentrations below 0.6 meq/liter developed neurotoxicity and were dropped from further analysis. For the remaining patients, Li+ with mean serum concentrations up to 0.6 meq/liter did not alter memory scores significantly. The dramatic increases in RBC choline during the study, however, suggest that RBC choline is not correlated with memory functioning in SDAT.
