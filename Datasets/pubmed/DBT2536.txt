The development of obesity in genetically diabetic obese (db/db) mice pair fed with lean siblings. The importance of thermoregulatory thermogenesis.
The importance of reduced thermoregulatory thermogenesis as a mechanism for the high metabolic efficiency of the diabetic obese (db/db) mouse has been investigated. Young db/db mutants were pair fed to the ad libitum food intake of lean siblings for two weeks at two different environmental temperatures, 23 and 33 degrees C. At 23 degrees C, a temperature at which there is a substantial demand for thermoregulatory thermogenesis, the diabetic obese animals deposited 51% more total energy and 75% more fat than the lean mice. At 33 degrees C (thermoneutrality) where there is no requirement for thermoregulatory heat, the mutants deposited 25% more fat than lean animals, but there was no significant difference in the total energy gain of the two groups. Pair feeding resulted in a reduced protein deposition at both temperatures in the diabetic obese animals compared to the lean. It is concluded that the high metabolic efficiency of the diabetic obese mutant, like that of the obese (ob/ob) mouse, is caused by a low energy expenditure on thermoregulatory thermogenesis.
