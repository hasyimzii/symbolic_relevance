Behavior of plasma triglycerides and cholesterol in diabetic patients.
34 diabetic patients (24 females and 10 males) were studied and hypertriglyceridemia was found only in females. Obesity seems to be the most important factor determining hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. No correlation was found between glycosylated haemoglobin and triglycerides or cholesterol levels. Only a little correlation was found between fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides levels.
