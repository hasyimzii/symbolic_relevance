Education provides no protection against Alzheimer's disease.
It has been suggested that educational achievement confers protection against dementia. We examined educational level and age of onset in 28 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and assessed the progression of dementia over a mean period of 28 months using both a measure of neurobehavioral status and an index of functional impairment. No protective effect of education was found in either early  or late onset dementia.
