Treatment of breast cancer in aged women.
The AA. consider the problem of mammary cancer in the woman more than 70 years old. The incidence of this tumor is about 30% and therefore it is necessary an exact start of therapy. For the AA. the therapy must base itself essentially on a good locoregional treatment, that comes from the constant association of simple mastectomy, if possible with axillary curage, with radiant therapy with small dosages and for a long time, in case with alternate ranges. The systemic treatment must base itself fundamentally and only on an aspecific immunotherapy that can be begun very early and on an hormonal therapy. This hormonal therapy should be suggested, where is possible, by the results of hormonal dosage on plasma and urine.
