Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase expression in a Thy l alloantigen variant lymphoma cell line.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression was examined in the clones of the radiation induced murine leukemia, RL male 1, which differ in Thy 1.2 alloantigen expression and tumourigenicity in syngeneic mice. Both cell lines displayed predominant cytoplasmic localization of TdT and equal sensitivities to specific TdT inhibitors. The R1 male 1.3 + cell line (Thy 1.2 positive and tumourigenic) demonstrated overall higher levels of TdT activity and different elution patterns on phosphocellulose chromatography compared with the RL male 1.4   (Thy 1.2 negative and poorly tumourgenic) cell line. These findings suggest an association of TdT expression with tumourigenicity properties in leukemic T lymphocytes.
