Role of the senile plaque in neuropeptide deficits of Alzheimer's disease.
Senile plaques participate in a cropping of the dendritic tree of enkephalinergic dentate granule cells and hl and subicular pyramidal cells. Somatostatin containing pyramidal neurons are lost in Alzheimer's disease, whereas nonpyramidal somatostatin neurons are less affected. Fibers containing somatostatin penetrate immature, but not end stage senile plaques. The senile plaque may precipitate much of the hippocampal denervation seen in Alzheimer's disease.
