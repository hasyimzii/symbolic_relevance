Glycosylation inhibitors block the expression of LAV/HTLV III (HIV) glycoproteins.
The glycosylation inhibitors 2 deoxy D glucose (2 dGlc) and, to a lesser extent,  beta hydroxynorvaline blocked the formation of syncytia in HIV (LAV/HTLV III) infected cells. Using monospecific polyclonal antibodies against recombinant envelope proteins gp110 and gp41 or monoclonal antibodies against env gp110, we could demonstrate a marked reduction in the immunoreactivity of these antigens in HIV infected cells exposed to the glycosylation inhibitors. There was concomitant accumulation of core proteins p15 and p24, as shown by a solid phase radio immunoassay, and a decreased oligosaccharide synthesis of env proteins, as monitored by the incorporation of [6 3H]GlcNAc. The reverse transcriptase was not affected by the compounds. Glycosylation inhibitors may be considered for the chemotherapy of AIDS or AIDS related complex, or chemoprophylaxis of HIV positive individuals.
