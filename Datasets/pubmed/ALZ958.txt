Comparison of PET, MRI, and CT with pathology in a proven case of Alzheimer's disease.
Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and CT were carried out in a patient with Alzheimer's disease 16 months before he died. At autopsy, the gross appearance of the brain correlated with MRI and CT, which showed some regional atrophy. These were much less revealing than PET, which correlated with microscopic findings of neuronal loss and proliferation of glia. In areas of moderately impaired local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose, as revealed by reduced FDG uptake, there was some gliosis, primarily around the numerous senile plaques. In areas of severe metabolic impairment, there was a profound loss of neurons, extensive gliosis, and a diminished appearance of plaques. PET FDG is a better measure of the severity of Alzheimer's disease than MRI or CT, because it reflects the degree of neuronal pathology.
