Lymphadenopathy associated virus: from molecular biology to pathogenicity.
Recent data indicate that the lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) is morphologically similar to animal lentiviruses, such as equine infectious anemia and visna viruses. This finding, together with the cross reactivity of the core proteins of LAV with those of the equine infectious anemia virus and a similarity in genome structure and biological properties, allows LAV to be placed in the retroviral subfamily of Lentivirinae. Molecular data indicate a high degree of genetic variation of the virus, especially in the envelope gene, which have important implications for the origin of the virus (the T4 lymphotropism may be a recently acquired property) and for future immunization. Another problem is the role of viral infection in the induction of irreversible immunodeficiency. This syndrome occurs in a minority of infected persons, who generally have in common a past of antigenic stimulation and of immune depression before LAV infection.
