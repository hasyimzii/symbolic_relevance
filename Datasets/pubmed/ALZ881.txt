Multiple, single dose naltrexone administrations fail to effect overall cognitive functioning and plasma cortisol in individuals with probable Alzheimer's disease.
A double blind placebo controlled study was conducted in 10 individuals with probable Alzheimer's disease to assess the effects of varying doses of Naltrexone (0, 25, 50 and 100 mg) on cognitive functioning and on plasma cortisol. Each individual participated in four separate sessions at least three days apart. Naltrexone was found to improve performance in only one of the six psychometric tasks employed (Token Test). However, enhancement of Token Test performance was limited to the 25 mg Naltrexone dose and was mainly the result of an improvement on the part of the two most severely impaired patients. In contrast to the previous reports of elevations of plasma cortisol following administration of opiate antagonists to younger, non demented subjects, Naltrexone administration failed to produce any significant increase in plasma cortisol in Alzheimer's patients.
