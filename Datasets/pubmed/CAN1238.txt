Laminated Marlex methyl methacrylate prosthesis for massive chest wall resection.
Room temperature curing methyl methacrylate has been sandwiched between two layers of Marlex mesh and molded in the operating room to achieve chest wall stability following an extensive anterolateral resection. Reliable coverage with latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap has made this simple, aesthetically pleasing, and firm reconstruction practical, even in a patient who received high dose irradiation.
