Substances affecting the infection and replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
The effects of various compounds were studied quantitatively on the growth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For this we used a human T cell leukemia virus type I carrying cell line, MT 4 which is most permissive for HIV infection. The results are summarized as follows: 1) Prostaglandin E2 and 12 0 tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate enhanced the production of HIV significantly in MT 4 cells as well as a continuous HIV producer Molt 4/HTLV III cells. 2) Interferon gamma, retinoic acid and 3' azido 3' deoxythymidine inhibited the replication of HIV at the concentrations which were not cytotoxic. Mechanism of action of these compounds and its clinical implications are discussed.
