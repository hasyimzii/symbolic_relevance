Missense mutations in an infectious human immunodeficiency viral genome: functional mapping of tat and identification of the rev splice acceptor.
Single nucleotide alterations were introduced into an infectious clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to create a series of missense mutants in the tat coding region. Although mutations in a proline rich region and a basic lysine arginine rich region resulted in wild type phenotypes, five of six mutations in a cysteine rich domain completely abolished tat activity and virus replication. One cysteine mutant retained tat activity but was negative for virus expression. Surprisingly, this mutant could not be complemented by tat, and virus expression was restored only by cotransfection with a plasmid expressing the rev gene. Another mutant with an alteration toward the C terminal region showed significantly reduced tat activity and required complementation by a combination of tat and rev for virus replication. Further analysis revealed that a previously unrecognized splice acceptor site within this region, apparently used to generate the rev mRNA, had been altered. We provide evidence suggesting that tat and rev proteins are encoded by distinct mRNA species.
