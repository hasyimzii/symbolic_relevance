Sexual impotency: current knowledge and treatment I. Urology/sexuality clinic.
Investigative and therapeutic measures for evaluating sexual impotency are rather recent. Psychogenic and organic problems may overlap. Thorough clinical appraisal and objective tests are currently affording better differentiation of etiology and, consequently, appropriate treatment. Causes of and tests for sexual impotency guide the choice of treatment. Surgical intervention can be offered for irreversible organic impotency. However, most instances of acquired impotence are psychogenic. Any nonjudgmental, competent practitioner can aid victims of psychogenic impotence by a "listening and encouragement" method. Urologists, in particular, are commonly confronted with genital/sexual problems and may be best suited as primary therapists by developing interest in urologic counseling. A newly formed Urology/Sexuality Clinic at the University of California in San Francisco provides therapy for patients and offers training for resident physicians.
