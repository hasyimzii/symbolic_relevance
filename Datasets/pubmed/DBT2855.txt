The reproducibility of the oral glucose tolerance test over long (5 years) and short periods (1 week).
Three oral glucose tolerance tests (oGTT) have been performed in 312 non diabetic relatives of diabetics over a period of 10 years. In a second study 6 identical oGTT's have been performed at weekly intervals in 55 individuals. In this study the variance, calculated from the logarithmic values, increased in the following order: fasting (0.026), 1 h (0.035), 2 h (0.044) and 3 h values (0.047). The sum of the 1 h and 2 h values showed the lowest variance (0.024). No significant difference of the variances was found in the 43 individuals in whom both the long term and the short term studies have been performed. Thus, a great proportion of the total variance of glucose observed over longer periods only represents a random variation. This random variation is much higher than most other factors which might influence the result of an oGTT. A diagnosis based on a single oGTT is of only limited value.
