Critical follow up study of subjects with senile plaques: neuropathological, clinical, and electroencephalographic data (author's transl).
Frontal isocortex biopsy or operative specimens exhibited senile plaques in 25 patients aged 40 to 73 years, association with Alzheimer's "neurofibrillary degeneration" in 20 of them. These patients were followed up for up to 14 years. 3 patients died 1 to 3 months after operation. 16 patients evolved into confirmed dementia, 12 of them most probably of the Alzheimer type. 6 patients recovered fully, and their subsequent evolution appears incompatible with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (follow up period of 3 to 14 years). Retrospective evaluation of EEG data showed a good predictive value of previously described EEG changes, as indicative of later confirmation of alzheimer's dementia.
