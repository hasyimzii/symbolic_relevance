Post encephalitic hypothalamic pituitary insufficiency.
Pituitary function was investigated in 3 patients who developed hypothalamic pituitary insufficiency after viral meningoencephalitis. In 2 patients the causative agents were probably Influenza A and Herpes simplex virus whereas in the third patient it was not identified. The pattern of hormonal deficiencies indicated that all the central regulatory areas   hypothalamus, pituitary stalk and pituitary gland   may be injured after viral meningoencephalitis. Usually, the hormonal deficiency is permanent but it can also be transient.
