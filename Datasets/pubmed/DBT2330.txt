Open lung biopsy in the renal transplant recipient.
In 22 renal transplant recipients, 23 open lung biopsy procedures were performed. There were two (8.7%) biopsy related complications (hemorrhage and pneumothorax) and five deaths (22.7%), although the deaths could not be definitely related to the biopsy procedure itself. Seventeen biopsy specimens yielded specific diagnoses, and six were nonspecific. The mortality rate for the patients with specific diagnoses was not significantly different from that of patients with nonspecific diagnoses (25% vs. 16.7%). Other factors analyzed, such as age, diabetes, hypoxia, leukopenia, and donor source, did not affect the result of biopsy. We conclude that the patient's underlying disease and added immunosuppressive therapy are the factors most responsible for the clinical outcome. We suggest that without early treatment of the infectious agents, the mortality rate of the group with specific diagnoses would likely have been higher.
