The hypothalamic pituitary axis in diabetes mellitus.
The hormonal response to LHRH and TRH was evaluated in three groups of male diaetics. Five patients were receiving therapy with the hypoglycemic agent glibenclamide, five were on NPH insulin and five were on dietary therapy alone. When compared to controls, the latter two groups had intact gonadotropin responses to LHRH. Despite normal basal gonadotropin levels, however, the group receiving glibenclamide therapy showed significantly exaggerated LH and FSH responses to LHRH. Both basal PRL and TSH levels, as well as the responses to TRH were normal in all three groups. These results indicate that LH, FSH, TSH and PRL secretion is intact in uncomplicated diabetes mellitus. The exaggerated LH and FSH responses to LHRH in the glibenclamide treated subjects are probably related to primary gonadal involvement; alternatively, there may be augmented pituitary gonadotropin secretion in this group.
