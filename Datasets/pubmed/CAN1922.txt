Immunohistochemistry of Warthin's tumor.
This study describes results of fresh frozen immunohistochemistry applied to two  typical Warthin's tumors. Polyclonal follicular center cell staining and an apparent reduction in the number of T lymphocytes were found. These observations tend to support the concept that the lymphoid infiltrate in Warthin's tumor represents a reactive cellular proliferation.
