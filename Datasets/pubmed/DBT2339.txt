Lysosomal enzymes in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy.
The present study examines the role of cardiac lysosomal enzymes in the pathogenesis of the cardiomyopathy that develops in genetically diabetic C57BL/KsJ db+/db+ mice. Db+/db+ mice and littermate controls were sacrificed as age matched pairs between 5 26 weeks of age. C57BL/6J ob/ob mice and littermates served as other controls. The hearts were excised, homogenized, and the following enzymatic activities measured: N Acetyl beta glucosaminidase, N acetyl beta galactosaminidase, beta glucosaminidase, aryl sulphatase, alpha mannosidase, alpha glucosidase, beta galactosidase, beta glucosidase, total p nitrophenyl phosphatase, acid phosphatase and 5' phosphodiesterase type IV. There is a progressive decrease in cardiac lysosomal enzyme activities of db+/db+ mice for the period 5 21 weeks of age. All enzyme activity is depressed significantly during the 9 21 week interval with beta glucuronidase, aryl sulphatase and beta glucosidase decreased about 40 50%. The decrease in lysosomal enzyme activity can explain the accumulation of large residual bodies and interstitial material in the myocardium of the db+/db+ animals
