Ventromedial hypothalamic lesions increase pancreatic sensitivity to streptozotocin in rats.
Rats with electroytic lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMX rats) and sham operated controls (SHAM rats) were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 50 mg/kg 48 h after the lesions were made. VMX rats were significantly more sensitive to STZ in that over 70% died within 6 wk, shereas none of the SHAM rats dies. When smaller doses of STZ were given to VMX rats (30  35 mg/kg), a large percentage still died, although the survivors appeared equally as diabetic (in terms of hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia) as SHAM rats given a larger dose of STZ. At 25 mg/kg, the surviving VMX rats were more hyperglycemic than matched controls. We suggest that the increased B cell activity known to occur in VMX animals might be the important factor in the increased sensitivity to STZ observed. We speculate that similar variation in pancreatic B cell response to an environmental injury may be an important determinant of diabetes susceptibility in man.
