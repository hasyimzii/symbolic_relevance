An alternative to cadaver kidney transplants for patients with insulin dependent  diabetes mellitus.
The benefits of successful kidney transplants for patients with end stage renal disease associated with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus are well known, and the potential advantages of earlier transplantation have been emphasized in other reports. Cadaver transplants, which are not always available for these patients, have not provided a high degree of success in many centers. This has discouraged the use of transplants unless well matched related donors are available. Most patients do not have well matched family members who are able to donate. We have attempted to increase the availability of related transplants for diabetic patients by using a new protocol in which related donors who are poorly matched by mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) testing (stimulation index (SI) greater than or equal to 7) can often serve as the source of the transplant. This protocol of pretransplant donor specific transfusions (DSTs) has been applied to 20 diabetic patients. Sixteen transplants have been performed after serial immunological studies following the DSTs detected no specific evidence of recipient sensitization to the respective transfusion donors. Only one of the transplants has been rejected, and this occurred in a patient who intentionally terminated immunosuppressive therapy. Graft survival for the group of 16 patients is 93 and 84% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. The quality of renal function for most of the patients is very good, with a mean serum creatinine of 1.9 and 1.5 ml/dl for those transplants at risk for 12 and 24 months. This new method has given encouraging results for poorly matched related transplants in diabetic patients and makes earlier transplantation possible by providing an alternative to cadaver transplants.
