Linitis plastica caused by metastatic lobular carcinoma of the breast.
We describe herein the syndrome of linitis plastica caused by metastatic lobular  carcinoma of the breast. In 14 of our 31 patients, gastric involvement, alone or concurrent with other metastasis, provided the first sign of tumor dissemination. The distinction of primary and secondary gastric malignancies in patients with a history of breast cancer is most important for successful management of patients. At a time when primary gastric carcinoma is decreasing nationally, an awareness of the association of lobular breast tumors with linitis plastica due to metastases may modify diagnostic evaluation and treatment planning in patients who present with symptoms of this syndrome.
