Studies on the synthesis of chemotherapeutics. 10. Synthesis and antitumor activity of N acyl  and N (alkoxycarbonyl) 5 fluorouracil derivatives.
A number of N acyl and N (alkoxycarbonyl) 5 fluorouracil derivatives possessing,  for example, benzoyl, o toluyl, acetyl, propionyl, heptanoyl, ethoxycarbonyl, phenoxycarbonyl, and benzyloxycarbonyl groups as N1 and/or N3 substituents were synthesized, and their antitumor activities were evaluated. The synthesis was achieved by a direct and two step acylation of 5 fluorouracil and by selective N1 deacetylation of N1 acetyl N3 substituted 5 fluorouracil under appropriate reaction conditions. Several N3 benzoyl  and N3 o toluyl 5 fluorouracil derivates and showed significant activity against experimental tumor, and N1 acetyl N3 o toluyl 5 fluorouracil was found to be most promising among them. Further investigation revealed 12 to retain higher activity toward various tumors, with lower toxicity and good blood level, than either 1 or FT 207, even for oral administration.
