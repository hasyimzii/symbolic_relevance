HLA class II glycoprotein expression by monocytes from HIV infected individuals:  differences in response to interferon gamma.
The expression of HLA class II glycoproteins by monocytes from HIV infected individuals was evaluated. We found no differences in HLA DR, HLA DQ, or HLA DP expression by freshly isolated monocytes from patients with clinical AIDS, HIV infected patients without AIDS or from uninfected individuals. However, monocytes from HIV infected individuals without AIDS responded better to stimulation with recombinant human interferon gamma (IFN gamma) than did monocytes from patients with clinical AIDS or from uninfected individuals. The response to IFN gamma stimulation by monocytes from patients with clinical AIDS was different. Thus, the largest increases in the percentage of cells expressing HLA DR was associated with the smallest changes in the fluorescence intensity of the population that is observed following stimulation of monocytes from other patient populations.
