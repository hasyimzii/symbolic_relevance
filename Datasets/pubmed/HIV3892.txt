Immune responses to fractionated cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens after HIV infection. Loss of cellular and humoral reactivity to antigens recognized by HIV , CMV+ individuals.
In order to delineate the molecular pathogenesis of the increased susceptibility  to CMV disease in HIV infection, the patterns of antigen responsiveness in HIV infected and non infected individuals were investigated. CMV was fractionated by SDS PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Lymphoproliferative responses of healthy HIV , CMV+ individuals and HIV+, CMV+ asymptomatic patients to a whole CMV antigen preparation and to 20 fractions of nitrocellulose bound CMV were then compared. Three fractions of approximate molecular weight of 130 165, 65 75, and 55 65 kD appeared to contain the major T cell stimulating antigens for HIV , CMV+ individuals. A statistically significant depression of responses to fractions containing antigens in the ranges of 130 165 kD and 55 65 kD but not to whole CMV was seen in HIV+ individuals compared with controls. In healthy controls, the sum of the proliferative responses as measured by 3H thymidine uptake to these three major fractions was approximately equal to the response to a whole CMV antigen preparation, whereas it was less than half of this response in five out of six HIV+ subjects. When antibody activities to CMV antigens were analysed by immunoblotting of sera from the two subject groups and also sera of ARC and AIDS patients, a selective loss of reactivity was revealed in 10 out of 19 HIV+ subjects to a band of 26 28 kD whereas all 15 HIV , CMV+ controls recognized this band. Serum IgG and IgM values were both significantly higher in HIV+ individuals than in controls. These findings suggest that specific lesions in the repertoire of immune responsiveness to CMV antigens occur in HIV+ individuals.
