Effect of HIV antibody disclosure on subsequent sexual activity in homosexual men.
During a prospective study of the natural history of AIDS, 1001 homosexual or bisexual men were offered the opportunity to learn their HIV antibody status. Six hundred and seventy (67%) of the population who elected to do so were similar to the 331 (33%) people who declined in a number of baseline characteristics. All were counselled to practice safe sex. To determine whether disclosure of HIV serologic status affects subsequent sexual behavior, we examined changes at four time points in three sexual activities during the previous 6 months: the number of male partners with whom the participant had (1) sexual intercourse, (2) unprotected anal receptive intercourse, and (3) unprotected anal insertive intercourse. All activities decreased strikingly over the 18 month study period. Following disclosure, the mean number of partners dropped to 47% of the baseline number in people remaining unaware of their antibody status, to 45% in people told that they were seropositive, and to 55% in people told that they were seronegative. The mean number of partners for younger seropositives declined less than that for older seropositives. The mean number of partners with whom unprotected anal receptive intercourse was practiced declined to 57% of baseline in unaware people, 42% in aware seropositives, and 62% in aware seronegatives. The mean number of partners with whom unprotected anal insertive intercourse was practiced declined to 52% of baseline in unaware people, 42% in aware seropositives and 59% in aware seronegatives. Disclosure of a negative test result led to a significantly smaller decline in these sexual activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
