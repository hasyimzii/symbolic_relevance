Scintigraphic evaluation of the skeleton in multiple myeloma.
The effectiveness of bone scintigraphy for the detection of skeletal involvement  in multiple myeloma was studied in 27 patients. Bone scintigrams and roentgenographic surveys were performed every 6 months for a period of 5 years or less, depending on the final course of the disease. This group was compared with a group of 100 patients with prostatic cancer at the time of initial diagnosis. In the myeloma group, roentgenographic skeletal surveys indicated bone involvement with greater specificity and sensitivity at the time of the initial diagnosis, in follow up studies, and in the evaluation of bone pain than did scintigrams. In contrast to results in prostatic cancer, the bone scan added little to the management of patients with multiple myeloma.
