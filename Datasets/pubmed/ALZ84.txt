Neuropathological and biochemical observations on the noradrenergic system in Alzheimer's disease.
Abnormalities of the noradrenergic system in Alzheimer's disease have been investigated by comparing quantitative histological and biochemical components of this transmitter system (locus coeruleus neuron counts and cortical dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) activity, respectively) in a series of demented and non demented cases. Cortical activities of the noradrenergic enzyme, DBH, did not correlate significantly with the number of locus coeruleus neurons, a finding which contrasts with the previous observations in animal brains of reductions in cortical DBH following locus coeruleus lesions. The extent of Alzheimer type abnormalities, assessed from either morphological measures (mean plaque counts) or clinical measures (Mental Test Scores) of severity, was not significantly related to the cortical activity of DBH in the present series of cases, although non significant trends were apparent. In contrast the activity of the cholinergic enzyme choline acetyltransferase did, as previously reported, correlate significantly with the extent of Alzheimer type abnormalities, suggesting that abnormalities of the cholinergic system are more closely associated with specific aspects of the Alzheimer disease process than those of the noradrenergic system.
