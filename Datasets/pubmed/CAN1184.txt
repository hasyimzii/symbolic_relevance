Ca2+ dependent protein phosphorylation and insulin release in intact hamster insulinoma cells. Inhibition by trifluoperazine.
Ca2+ dependent protein phosphorylation was studied in intact hamster insulinoma cells. Depolarizing concentrations of potassium which stimulate Ca2+ uptake and insulin release by these cells also increased phosphorylation of one peptide, Mr = 60,000 (P60). This was demonstrated by incubating 32P labeled insulinoma cells in media containing 50 mM K+ followed by analysis of the cellular proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Potassium induced phosphorylation of P60 was nearly half maximal after 1 min and reached a plateau by 10 min. The enhanced 32P labeling of P60 observed in the presence of 50 mM K+ was Ca2+ dependent since omission of extracellular Ca2+ or addition of the Ca2+ channel blocker alpha isopropyl alpha [(N methyl N homoveratryl) gamma aminopropyl]3,4,5 trimetho xyphenylacetonitrile hydrochloride prevented the effect. Glucagon (3 microM), which stimulates insulin release in a cAMP dependent manner, had no effect on P60 phosphorylation. A possible involvement of calmodulin was explored in studies using trifluoperazine. The Ca2+ dependent increase in phosphorylation of P60 was prevented by trifluoperazine. Moreover, Ca2+ influx mediated insulin release and P60 phosphorylation were inhibited at nearly identical concentrations of trifluoperazine. Half maximal inhibition of potassium induced insulin release and P60 phosphorylation was seen at 2.6 microM and 2.5 microM trifluoperazine, respectively. The data are consistent with a sequence of events involving Ca2+ influx, phosphorylation of P60 by a calmodulin dependent protein kinase, and resultant insulin secretion.
