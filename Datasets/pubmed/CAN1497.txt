Comparison of the effects of transcortical and transcallosal removal of intraventricular tumours.
Intelligence and memory functions were tested in 2 patients in whom the corpus callosum had been partially sectioned to remove intraventricular cysts or tumours and in 2 patients in whom similarly located cysts or tumours had been removed transcortically. A patient with congenital absence of the corpus callosum was also tested. Callosal lesions per se did not appear to be responsible for memory deficits.
