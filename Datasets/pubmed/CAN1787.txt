T lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood and tissues of cancer patients.
Patients with cancer often show impaired immune functions; however, the basis of  this suppression is still not understood. In several experimental systems, human T cells with receptors for Fc of immunoglobulin G may function as suppressors, and those with receptors for Fc of immunoglobulin M may function as helpers. Peripheral blood as well as tumor tissue infiltrates were examined for proportions and numbers of T gamma, T mu, or Ia positive T cells. Forty five untreated patients with solid tumors and 24 patients with lymphomas were studied. An increase in the percentage of peripheral blood T gamma cells (p < 0.001) and a decrease in T mu cells (p < 0.0005) were recorded in all tumor patients when compared with 30 normal controls. Percentages and absolute numbers of peripheral blood Ia positive T cells were decreased (p < 0.001 and < 0.00001) in solid tumor patients; by contrast, the proportion of peripheral blood Ia positive T cells was elevated (p < 0.005) in lymphoma subjects. Studies of cancer tissues from 46 untreated patients using immunofluorescence and mouse hybridoma antibody specific for T cells showed that tumor lymphocytic infiltrates were composed mainly of T cells. Double staining with fluorescein conjugated specific anti T gamma and Ia positive T cells within solid tumor lymphoid infiltrates. A comparison of peripheral blood and tumor lymphocyte T cell profiles revealed that, in some patients, low proportions of Ia positive T cells in blood were paralleled by a high percentage of such cells in tumor lymphoid infiltrates.
