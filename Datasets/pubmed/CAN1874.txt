Isolation and characterization of a myeloma  spleen cell hybrid producing antibody to phenylalanine hydroxylase.
Application of the technique of myeloma  spleen cell fusion [Kohler & Milstein (1975) Nature (London) 256, 495  497] has allowed the isolation of a cell colony that produced a monoclonal antibody against monkey liver phenylalanine hydroxylase. The antibody exhibited cross reactivity against hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase from other mammalian species, including human, rat and mouse. Cross reactivity was established by (a) enzyme inhibition assay, (b) double immunodiffusion reaction, and (c) two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of immunoprecipitate. The various properties of the monoclonal antibody and its use in the study of mammalian phenylalanine hydroxylase are presented.
