Pathology, diagnosis and treatment of uroepithelial tumours of the urinary tract (author's transl).
Report on 38 patients with uroepithelial tumours of the urinary tract treated between 1969 and 1977. In 38% of the cases multiple tumours were found. The clinical parameters and diagnostic problems are discussed by means of case reports, pathology and possibilities of treatment are discussed on the basis of the own cases and the literature. In order to achieve the most favourable prognosis in this type of malignant tumour it will be necessary to be more radical in treatment and more intensive in controls after treatment and to subject the high risk groups more frequent check ups.
