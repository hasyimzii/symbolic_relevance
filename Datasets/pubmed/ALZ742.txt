Aberrant neurofilament phosphorylation in Alzheimer disease.
Alzheimer tangles, despite their location in neuronal perikarya, react immunocytochemically with monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated epitopes of neurofilaments. Normal perikarya do not contain phosphorylated neurofilaments. The aberrant phosphorylation in both plaques and tangles seems to be largely restricted to individual phosphorylation sites among the many sites available in neurofilaments. It is suggested that the Alzheimer lesion involves an imbalance within specific kinases responsible for phosphorylation of different sites in neurofilaments.
