Significance of adenosine for the hormone responsiveness of adenylate cyclase in  adipose tissue of normoglycemic and hyperglycemic sand rats.
In young sand rats, bred in our colony, the metabolism was directed from the normoglycemic state by means of feeding conditions. The noradrenaline action on adenylate cyclase is impaired in hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic sand rats. Generally, addition of adenosine to the in vitro system eliminates the responsiveness of the adenylate cyclase to noradrenaline in adipose tissue. The presence of adenosine deaminase in the incubation medium abolished this inhibition effect of added adenosine. The interference of released adenosine with the hormone action in vitro was excluded by addition of adenosine deaminase to the incubation medium. In both groups of sand rats adenosine deaminase did not increase the noradrenaline effect on adenylate cyclase. Investigations were carried out as a part of the research project "Diabetes mellitus and diseases of fat metabolism". These results along with the others on the measured adenosine release exclude adenosine as a reason for the disturbed hormone action on adenylate cyclase in hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic sand rats.
