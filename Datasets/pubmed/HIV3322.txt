Platelet associated immunoglobulin G (PAIgG) and circulating immune complexes in asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV seropositive patients.
Circulating immune complexes and platelet associated immunoglobulins G (PAIgG) were measured in 14 clinically asymptomatic and 9 diseased HIV infected subjects and compared to their platelet counts in the peripheral blood. In both groups, circulating immune complexes were found to be increased even in the presence of normal platelet counts. Increased PAIgG levels were found in symptomatic HIV infected subjects, along with thrombocytopenia. This study indicates that the mere occurrence of circulating immune complexes is an insufficient finding for induction of thrombocytopenia. Either the molecular composition of the complexes is different in both patient groups, or the thrombocytopenia is induced by additional platelet damaging compounds, e.g. specific antiplatelet antibodies induced by the viral infection.
