Surfactant lipoprotein concentration in amniotic fluid of abnormal pregnancies and premature deliveries (author's transl).
As shown in our previous report surfactant lipoprotein concentration (SLPC) in amniotic fluid measured by sucrose density gradient centrifugation predicts accurately the risk of RDS. In this study SLPC estimations were made on 91 amniotic fluid samples from abnormal pregnancies, spontaneous premature deliveries and anencephalies. The results were as follows. SLPCs increased in placental insufficiency and severe preeclampsia, especially associated with SFD infant, on the other hand, SLPCs decreased in maternal diabetes (Class B), Rh isoimmunization and anencephaly as compared with normal pregnancy. In most of premature deliveries SLPCs were higher than those of normal pregnancies except for RDS cases. Present evidence suggests that the maturation of fetal lung is accelerated in severe preeclampsia and placental insufficiency and is delayed in maternal diabetes (Class B), Rh isoimmunization and anencephaly, and it is considered that in spontaneous premature delivery surfactant production in fetal lung is not accelerated but surfactant excretion from fetal lung into amniotic fluid is enhanced by effect of uterine relaxant such as isoxsuprine or terbutaline.
