Characterization of gangliosides in human leucocytes.
Lipids extracted from leucocyte pellets with chloroform methanol were applied to  a DEAE Sephadex column an the gangliosides were eluted with 0.2M sodium acetate in methanol. The eluate was desalted by Sephadex G 50 column chromatography. The purified ganglioside was spotted on the high performance than layer plate. The plate was developed and sprayed with resorcinol reagents and heated. Seventeen bands of gangliosides were demonstrated in normal human leucocytes. The composition of these gangliosides was different in the various kinds of leucocytes. Amounts of GM3 ganglioside were apparently greater in normal lymphocytes and leukaemic cells than in granulocytes. Among the acute leukaemic cells, some kinds of complex gangliosides were much more abundant in myelogenous cells than in lymphocytic cells. These changes in ganglioside composition are suggested as new biochemical markers for leukaemic cells.
