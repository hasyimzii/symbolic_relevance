Hyperosmolar non ketotic diabetic coma in children (author's transl).
A 12 year old female patient presenting non ketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemic coma as initial sign of diabetes mellitus is presented. She was successfully treated with continuous infusion of low dose of insulin and saline and glycosaline isotonic sera. Potassium was precociously added to the hydrating solutions. During convalescence she suffered a left iliofemoral thrombophlebitis which remitted with appropriate treatment. In coma stage, C peptide was close to normal, indicating active insulin production by the pancreas.
