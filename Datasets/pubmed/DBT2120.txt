Microencapsulated islets as bioartificial endocrine pancreas.
Single implantation of microencapsulated islets into rats with streptozotocin induced diabetes corrected the diabetic state for 2 to 3 weeks. The microencapsulated islets remained morphologically and functionally intact throughout long term culture studies lasting over 15 weeks.
