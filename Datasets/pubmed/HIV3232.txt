Anti termination of transcription within the long terminal repeat of HIV 1 by tat gene product.
Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) gene expression is controlled by cellular  transcription factors and by virally encoded trans activation proteins of the HIV 1 tat and art/trs genes, which are essential for viral replication. Tat trans activates HIV 1 gene expression by interacting with the trans acting response element (TAR) located within the HIV 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) (ref. 2). In transient expression assays, tat mediates its effects largely by increasing the steady state levels of messenger RNA species that contain the TAR sequence at or near their 5' ends, suggesting a function for tat either in transcription or in subsequent RNA processing. The tat gene could also facilitate translation of mRNA containing the TAR sequence. To determine the mechanism of trans activation by tat, we analysed the structure and rate of synthesis of RNA species directed by the HIV 1 LTR in transient expression assays both in the presence and absence of tat. Although the rate of HIV 1 transcription initiation was not affected by tat, transcriptional elongation beyond position +59 was seen only in the presence of tat. Thus, tat trans activates HIV 1 transcription by relieving a specific block to transcriptional elongation within the TAR sequence.
