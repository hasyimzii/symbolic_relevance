Isolation and characterization of heparin from human mastocytoma tissue.
Polysaccharide was isolated from human spleen mastocytoma by proteolytic digestion, precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride, digestion with chondroitinase ABC, and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE cellulose. The final product (0.7 mg per g of starting material, MW 8000) behaved like standard heparin on ion exchange chromatography and on electrophoresis, and contained D glucuronic acid, L iduronic acid, D glucosamine and sulfate in the proportions expected for heparin. Affinity chromatography on antithrombin Sepharose separated a distinct high affinity fraction (4 5% of the total material). Structural analysis of this fraction showed that about 10% of the D glucosamine residues were N acetylated, the remainder N sulfated. The anticoagulant activity of the isolated heparin was 71 B.P. units per mg (whole blood system), or 30 units per mg (anti thrombin and chromogenic substrate). 205 and 10 15 units per mg (chromogenic assay) were found for high and low affinity fractions, respectively. These results demonstrate conclusively the occurrence of heparin in a human tissue.
