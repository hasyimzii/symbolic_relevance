Right ventricular myxoma. Case report and review of phonocardiographic and auscultatory manifestations.
Tumors in the right ventricle are extremely rare. This report concerns the pathogenesis of physical signs resulting from a right ventricular myxoma. In systole a loud midsystolic murmur representing outflow obstruction was present. In diastole a prominent vibration was heard and recorded. By echophonocardiography this noise could be ascribed to sudden halting of the retrograde excursion of the mass into the right ventricle  a mechanism analogus to the tumor "plop" associated with the halting of antegrade movement of a left atrial myxoma in the left ventricle in early diastole.
