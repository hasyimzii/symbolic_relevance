Functional comparison of the Rev trans activators encoded by different primate immunodeficiency virus species.
The known primate lentiviruses can be divided into two subgroups consisting of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) isolates and the related HIV type 2 (HIV 2) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates. HIV 1 has been shown to encode a post transcriptional trans activator of viral structural gene expression, termed Rev, that is essential for viral replication in culture. Here, we demonstrate that HIV 2 and SIVmac also encode functional Rev proteins. As in the case of HIV 1, these Rev trans activators are shown to induce the cytoplasmic expression of the unspliced viral transcripts that encode the viral structural proteins. Unexpectedly, the Rev proteins of HIV 2 and SIVmac proved incapable of activating the cytoplasmic expression of unspliced HIV 1 transcripts, whereas HIV 1 Rev was fully functional in the HIV 2/SIV system. This nonreciprocal complementation may imply a direct role for Rev in mediating the recognition of its viral RNA target sequence.
