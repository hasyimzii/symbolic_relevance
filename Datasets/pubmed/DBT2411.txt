Survey of knowledge among primary health care workers in diabetes.
The knowledge of diabetes mellitus held by allied health professionals in Kentucky and the short term and long term effectiveness of a symposium in altering this knowledge was studied. The groups investigated consisted of: 136 primary health workers (nurses, dieticians, health educators, and other health professionals) surveyed before and after the 12 hour symposium (group 1); 37 of these primary health professionals studied again one year after the first symposium (group 2); and 26 nurses who work at a university hospital, and who did not attend the symposium (group 3). Before training, all groups performed similarly on this survey. Group 1 scored 58.5 +/  0.2% correct, group 2, 56.9 +/  3.1% correct, and group 3, 52.7 +/  5.0% correct. Performance did not correlate with educational level, job description, or geographic location within Kentucky. There was a negative correlation between performance and age for group 1 (r =  0.3494, P < .001). Follow up studies immediately after the symposium showed that a significant improvement occurred in the performance of group 1 and group 2 on this knowledge survey (correct score +/  SEM = 82.5 +/  0.3%, and 81.7 +/  2.4% respectively, P < .005) compared to pretraining scores. A repeat survey of group 2 one year later showed a significant deterioration of knowledge (P < .05), but not to pretraining levels (mean correct score = 69.2 +/  3.4% at one year versus 56.9 +/  3.1% before training, P < .02). These results suggest that more emphasis on professional education in diabetes and study of effective methods for providing this education is required.
