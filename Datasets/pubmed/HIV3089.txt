Unique pattern of HTLV III (AIDS related) antigen recognition by sera from African children in Uganda (1972).
Of 75 sera collected in the West Nile district of Uganda over a 1 year period between 1972 and 1973, 50 (66%) had antibody reactivity to human T cell lymphotropic virus subgroup III (HTLV III) at low titer levels. Sera were initially screened by HTLV III enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and sera with values less than normal mean + 2 SD were removed from testing. The remaining sera were tested for positivity by an amplified Western blotting procedure which incorporated a three layer immunoperoxidase procedure. Immunoglobulin reactive with HTLV III Mr 24,000, 41,000, and 76,000 proteins were present in nearly all positive sera. The antibody status of this group was unlike any normal or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome risk group previously tested. The high prevalence and relatively low titers suggest the detection as early as 1972 of a relative or predecessor of HTLV III or of HTLV III itself but existing in a population acclimated to its presence. It further suggests a likely African origin of HTLV III.
