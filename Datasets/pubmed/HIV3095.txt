Epidemiological evidence that HTLV III is the AIDS agent.
Human T lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III) is a recently discovered retrovirus with tropism and cytotoxicity for the OKT4+ lymphocytes that are depleted in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In addition to the frequent detection of HTLV III in patients with AIDS and related syndromes, seroepidemiological studies have shown that HTLV III can be transmitted by sexual contact and blood transfusion in a manner identical to the putative AIDS agent. Analyses of stored sera have revealed that HTLV III antibodies appeared in high risk groups some two years before the disease outbreak, which corresponds to the apparent incubation period in patients with transfusion associated AIDS. The risk of developing AIDS is clearly associated with HTLV III seropositivity and may be as high as 20% within three years. Strong evidence that HTLV III is the AIDS agent mandates aggressive efforts to minimize further sexual, maternal fetal, and blood borne transmission of this virus while pursuing vaccine development and antiretroviral therapies.
