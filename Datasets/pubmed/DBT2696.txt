A new mutation (db3J) at the diabetes locus in strain 129/J mice. II. Studies of  pancreatic alpha cell function in culture.
Monolayer cell cultures from pancreatic islets of aging 129/J strain diabetes (db3J/db3J) and lean littermate control mice were tested for differences in glucagon and insulin secretion in either serum free Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) or Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM). There was a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) main effect of genotype and type of culture medium on glucagon secretion with time. Thus, although numbers of A cells were not demonstrably increased in db3J/db3J cultures in DMEM, mean medium glucagon levels increased 2.7 , 18 , and 32 fold above littermate normal culture levels at days 4, 6, and 8 respectively. In MEM, the two populations could not be discriminated on the basis of glucagon secretion. By contrast, insulin secretion over culture days showed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) dependence on genotype, but not type of medium, with the B cell enriched db3J/db3J preparations secreting between 20 and 30 times as much insulin as controls in both medida. Analysis revealed that the heightened secretory responsiveness of mutatn A cells in DMEM as compared to MEM was primarily elicited by the elevated DMEM amino acid concentration and specifically lysine (0.8 mmol/l in DMEM versus 0.4 mmol/l in MEM). In pulse chase experiments using 14 day db3J/db3J cultures, incorporation of 3H tryptophan into protein that eluted from Biogel P 10 columns in the native glucagon peak indicates that DMEM stimulated glucagon biosynthesis as well as secretion. This study reveals an augmented sensitivity of db3J/db3J A cells to stimulation by basic amino acids in long term culture.
