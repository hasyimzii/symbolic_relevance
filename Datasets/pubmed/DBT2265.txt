Hypertension as a clinical syndrome.
The essential hypertension, at present scarcely existing as isolated and unique disease, proves to be one of the main participants in multimorbidity. The evaluation of the own patients of the past 10 years according to the concomitant diseases of hypertension leads unconventionally to a subdivision in two groups: a "coloured" in which hypertension together appears with another chronic disease or also various diseases and a second group, in which the hypertension appears in a constantly composed "standardized" connection of diseases: with adiposis, hyperlipoproteinaemia, diabetes, frequently still with hyperuricaemia and cholelithiasis. In this hypertensive metabolic syndrome we have to acknowledge a characteristic form of manifestation of hypertension, under simultaneous degradation to the symptom of a more comprehensive complex of disturbances. From the cooperation of the present individual diseases results a unique concentration of arteriosclerotic risk factors, so that course and result in the hypertensive metabolic syndrome are characterized by the arteriosclerosis with its organ manifestations, above all on heart and brain.
