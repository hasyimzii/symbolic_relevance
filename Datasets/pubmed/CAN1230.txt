Effect of nitrosoethylurea on sarcomagenesis induced by a foreign body.
Subcutaneous administration to rats of an intact cellophane plate gave rise to sarcomas in 60% of cases, the latent period being 16.5 month. Meanwhile administration of minced cellophane did not produce tumors. Combination of the plate subcutaneously and nitrosoethylurea (NEU) intraperitoneally increased the frequency of sarcomas to 73.3%, the latent period being 13.7 month. Sarcomas emerged in 33.3% of cases at the site of administering minced cellophane coupled with intraperitoneal injection of NEU, the latent period amounting to 13.2 month. The morphological appearance of sarcomas that occurred with the use of NEU differed from tht resultant from administering the cellophane plate alone. Adsorption of NEU on the cellophane is suggested.
