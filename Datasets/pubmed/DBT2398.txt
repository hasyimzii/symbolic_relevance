Spinal cord reflex activity characteristics of children with a diabetic heredity.
Stimulation electromyography has shown that children with hereditary diabetes mellitus develop functional disorders of the spinal cord reflex activity, manifesting in a decrease in correlations between musculus soleus reflex responses and motor ones, the delay of restoration of its segmental motoneuron stimulation, the disturbance of the tendon  and N reflex supraspinal regulation. The most distinctive sign of these disorders is the curve of segmental motoneuron stimulation recovery. This phenomenon may be valuable for revealing the latent neurological disturbances in persons with diabetes predisposition. It is suggested that the neurological changes revealed may be resultant of the hereditable metabolic specificity.
