Indications for exofacial parotidectomy in treatment of mixed tumors (author's transl).
Systematic total parotidectomy is still recommended by some authors for treatment of mixed tumors of the parotid. This attitude is based on the notion of multifocal involvement. In fact, multifocal involvement seems exceptional Very wide exeresis of the tumor is sufficient for efficient treatment, but the anatomical constitution of the parotid makes topographical division difficult. An attempt for systematisation of exeresis following the topography of the tumor is suggested, mainly for cases where parotidectomy is sufficient.
