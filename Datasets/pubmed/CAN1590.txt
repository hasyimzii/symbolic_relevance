Effects of hyperprolactinemia on calciotropic hormones.
Serum 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels as well as the renal handling of phosphorus were measured in female patients with hyperprolactinemia. Despite elevated prolactin levels, none of the patients showed an imbalance of the biochemical parameters of mineral homeostasis. Neither surgery nor bromocriptine treatment, both of which brought PRL within the normal limits, had an appreciable effect on the circulating concentrations of mineral and calciotropic hormones. These results do not allow us to assign a definite role to PRL in the control of mineral metabolism in man.
