Diabetes is associated with autoimmunity in the New Zealand obese (NZO) mouse.
The New Zealand Obese (NZO) mouse was studied as a potential model for autoimmune diabetes. NZO mice develop obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance, and have low titer IgM antibodies to the insulin receptor. It is shown that they have circulating antibodies to both native DNA and denatured, single stranded DNA. The antibody levels are higher in females, and, up to 6 mo of age, are comparable to those found in the related NZB X NZW F1 (NZB/W) mouse, a model for systemic lupus erythematosus. After 6 mo of age the antibody levels in NZO mice fall toward normal, in contrast to the persistently elevated levels in NZB/W mice. NZB/W mice are known to succumb to immune complex mediated proliferative glomerulonephritis before 1 yr of age, whereas NZO mice survive. NZO kidneys exhibit light microscopic features of both diabetic and lupus nephropathies: glomerular proliferation, mesangial deposits, mild basement membrane thickening, glomerulosclerosis, eosinophilic nodules in some glomeruli, occasional hyalinization of the glomerular arterioles, and healing arteriolar inflammation. These changes are associated with glomerular deposition of immunoglobulin, especially IgM, in a granular pattern on fluorescent staining. The NZO mouse, therefore, has evidence of a generalized immune disorder and provides a model for studying the relationship between autoimmunity, obesity, and diabetes.
