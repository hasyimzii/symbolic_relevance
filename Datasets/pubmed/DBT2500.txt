Beta blockade and diabetes mellitus: effect of oxprenolol and metoprolol on the metabolic, cardiovascular, and hormonal response to insulin induced hypoglycemia in normal subjects.
In a double blind randomized study, the effect of the acute administration of a single oral dose of oxprenolol, a nonselective beta blocker, and of metoprolol, a beta 1 selective blocker, on insulin induced hypoglycemia was tested in seven normal subjects. Neither of the drugs potentiated the hypoglycemic effect of insulin. The recovery from hypoglycemia was delayed by both blocking agents only in the late phases of the experimental observation. This effect could not be accounted for by suppression of release of the counterregulatory hormones glucagon or cortisol, but may be mediated by the inhibition of NEFA and gluconeogenic substrate release in response to hypoglycemia. Both drugs blocked the hypoglycemia induced tachycardia. Only oxprenolol raised diastolic blood pressure during hypoglycemia. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were not masked by either blocking agent, and sweating was enhanced and prolonged by both drugs. Thus, no clear cut differences in the glycemic response to insulin induced hypoglycemia were found between metoprolol and oxprenolol, but the drugs differed in their influence upon the blood pressure response to insulin induced hypoglycemia.
