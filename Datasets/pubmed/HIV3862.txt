Analysis of long terminal repeat circle junctions of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
Circle junctions of unintegrated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain IIIB  were analyzed after polymerase chain reaction amplification. Among the 28 colonies sequenced, eight unique circle junction species were detected. Five of the eight species resulted in circle junctions with larger inserts than predicted. A majority of these could result from heterogeneity in generating the U5' long terminal repeat terminus.
