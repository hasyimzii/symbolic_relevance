Immunofluorescence assay for detection of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 2.
A total of 215 serum samples were tested for antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV 2) with an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Some samples originated from Denmark and some originated from Guinea Bissau. The IFA results were compared with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western (immuno ) blot (WB) results. Twenty nine serum samples were found to be true positive for HIV 2 antibodies as judged from WB and radioimmunoprecipitation results; all of these were also found to be positive in the HIV 2 IFA. Of 80 serum samples originating from HIV 1 infected persons, 60% showed reactivity in the HIV 2 ELISA, and 51% cross reacted with at least one band in the HIV 2 WB. None of the sera cross reacted in the HIV 2 IFA. A total of five serum samples (three African and two Danish) gave unspecific results in the HIV 2 IFA. It is concluded that the HIV 2 IFA is more specific and at least as sensitive as a first generation ELISA and that IFA is superior to WB in discriminating between HIV 1 and HIV 2 infections.
