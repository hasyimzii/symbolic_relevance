Some enkephalin  or VIP immunoreactive hippocampal pyramidal cells contain neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of aged humans and persons with Alzheimer's disease.
Neurofibrillary tangles are one of the histopathological neuronal abnormalities present in normal aging and especially in Alzheimer's Disease. We have utilized immunocytochemical staining for neuropeptides followed by Congo red with gallocyanin counterstaining and polarized illumination to determine whether enkephalin (Enk), somatostatin (Som), cholecystokinin (CCK), or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are contained in neurons afflicted with such tangles. A few Enk  or VIP immunoreactive pyramidal cells in field hl and subiculum were found to contain tangles. Many such Enk  or VIP immunoreactive neurons and cells containing Som  or CCK like immunoreactivity did not contain such tangles.
