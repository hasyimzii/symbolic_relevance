Hodgkin disease of bone: radiographic correlation with the histological classification.
The relationship of bone involvement to the histological type of Hodgkin disease  was assessed. Of 175 patients reviewed, 36 had radiographic evidence of bone destruction. Among patients with mixed cellularity or lymphocytic depletion, whose prognosis was fair or poor, 64% had bone destruction. In patients with lymphocytic predominance or nodular sclerosis, whose prognosis was characterized as good, only 11% had bone destruction. Bone destruction in more aggressive histological types was also more likely to be permeative.
