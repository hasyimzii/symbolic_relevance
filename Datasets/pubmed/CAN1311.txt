Contribution to the technique of radiation therapy for the treatment of early stages in ovarian carcinoma (author's transl).
A new technique for radiation therapy in stage I and II carcinoma of the ovary is presented, intended to cover as homogeneously as possible the paraaortic, subdiaphragmatic and intradiaphragmatic areas of the direct lymphatic pathways as well as the small pelvis. This technique permits to deliver a dose of up to 46 Gy to this target volume, adjuvant chemotherapy being regarded as a convenient complement of such localized radiation therapy. Using a modern interactive system for treatment planning, a combination of 2 a. p./p. a. and 2 lateral fields is developed. Individually shaped circular satellites and rectangular satellites serve for protection of the liver and small intestine. Good reproducibility is obtained by means of the simple geometrical form of the fields and satellites.
