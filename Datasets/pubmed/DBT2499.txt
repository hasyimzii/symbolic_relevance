Beta blockade and diabetes mellitus: effect of oxprenolol and metoprolol on the metabolic, cardiovascular, and hormonal response to insulin induced hypoglycemia in insulin dependent diabetics.
The effect of the administration of a single oral dose of placebo, oxprenolol and metoprolol on insulin induced hypoglycemia was investigated in seven insulin dependent diabetics in a double blind randomized study. Neither of the beta blocking agents accelerated the plasma glucose lowering effect of insulin. Plasma glucose recovery from hypoglycemia was grossly impaired in diabetics whether blocked or not, and all investigations had to be terminated by i.v. glucose injection after 1 hr of sustained hypoglycemia. During the period of observation, no further delaying effect by either beta blocker was observed. The lack of plasma glucose recovery seems to be at least in part related to a retarded and reduced glucagon response to hypoglycemia. Both drugs blocked the hypoglycemia induced pulse rate increase, but neither caused bradycardia. A significant increase in diastolic pressure was recorded with oxprenolol, whereas a drop in systolic pressure was noted with metoprolol. Oxprenolol suppressed the NEFA rise after insulin infusion termination to a greater extent than did metoprolol. Hypoglycemic symptoms were not affected by beta blockade. The results suggest that neither drug further worsens the already grossly impaired plasma glucose recovery, but that oxprenolol and metoprolol may differ in their effects on hemodynamic response to hypoglycemia. This aspect of the problem requires further study under careful control in hypertensive diabetics.
