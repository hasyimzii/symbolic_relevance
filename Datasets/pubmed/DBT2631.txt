A comparison of three methods of measuring serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol in diabetics and non diabetics.
Serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was measured in non diabetic and diabetic men and women by ultracentrifugation, heparin manganese chloride precipitation (heparin/Mn++), and sodium phosphotungstate magnesium chloride precipitation (PT/Mg++). Results of the three methods were closely correlated in both diabetics and non diabetics. Concentrations were, however, generally lowest by PT/Mg++, intermediate by ultracentrifugation, and highest by heparin/Mn++. These differences were small magnitude except in the case of diabetic patients treated with insulin. In these patients, serum HDL cholesterol levels were significantly greater than those of non diabetic patients when measured by heparin/Mn++ and ultracentrifugation, but not by PT/Mg++. This was explained by the finding that the discrepancy between PT/Mg++ and ultracentrifugation increased with increasing HDL cholesterol concentration.
