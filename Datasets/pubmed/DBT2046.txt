The value of the oscillatory potential in selecting juvenile diabetics at risk of developing proliferative retinopathy.
A prospective long term study of the predictive value of the oscillatory potential in the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy has been made in 137 diabetics. Follow ups 6 8 and 13 15 years later demonstrated that recording the oscillatory potential in juvenile diabetics with a disease duration of more than 5 years is valuable in selecting those at risk of developing proliferative retinopathy within 6 years at any rate. The predictive value of the oscillatory potentials is probably more limited in women who later become pregnant.
