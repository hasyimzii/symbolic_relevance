Nephrotic syndrome in a patient with ulcerative colitis and colonic carcinoma.
A 27 year old man with a long history of ulcerative colitis developed a nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy revealed a minimal change lesion and further evaluation revealed that the patient had colonic carcinoma. Total colectomy and a course of prednisone were followed by a complete and lasting remission of the nephrotic syndrome. To our knowledge this is the first recorded case of minimal change nephrotic syndrome occurring in a patient with ulcerative colitis and colonic carcinoma.
