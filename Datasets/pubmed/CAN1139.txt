Cytomorphological study of the cerebrospinal fluid. II. Leukemias and lymphomas  (author's transl).
A cytological study of the cerebrospinal fluid from 25 patients with acute leukemias and five patients with malignant lymphomas (Hodgkin's disease and non Hodgkin's lymphoma) has been performed. All patients had clinical manifestations of central nervous system involvement at the time of lumbar puncture. Cytological abnormalities were observed in 13 out of the 30 samples examined (positivity: 44 percent). The group of 17 patients with lymphoblastic leukemia accounted for the highest cytological positivity (12 our of 17 cases   70.5 percent  ). Cerebrospinal fluid from eight patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia and from four patients with Hodgkin's disease was normal. Numerous cell atypias were found in a case of lymphocytic lymphoma. The importance of systematic cytological study of the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with leukemia in order to prevent recurrences and to control intrathecal administration of cytostatics and/or radiotherapy is stressed.
