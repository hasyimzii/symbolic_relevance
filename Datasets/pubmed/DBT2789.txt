Electrocardiographic changes during hyperbaric oxygenation in diabetes mellitus.
The results of electro  and polycardiograms characteristis of overloading of the  right parts of the heart were studied in 50 patients with diabetes mellitus. Dilatation of the right chambers of the heart was revealed, which the authors think may be mainly due to functional or organic changes in the vessels of pulmonary circulation and is associated with tissue hypoxia. The patients were given the commonly accepted therapy in a complex with hyperbaric oxygenation. Diabetes mellitus became compensated and a tendency towards regression of the earlier revealed changes was noted.
