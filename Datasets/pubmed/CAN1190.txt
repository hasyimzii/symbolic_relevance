Hypoglycemia inducing islet cell tumors. Measurement of blood glucose and insulin levels during operation. Results in seven cases (author's transl).
The identification of hypoglycemic langerhans tumours by the surgeon, being sometimes difficult, per operative quantity determinations of the glycemia and insulinemia levels help to ensure that all the insulino secretory tissue has been removed. The technical protocol described includes an excess of glucids. In the 5 cases of adenomas, between 30 and 60 minutes after exeresis, a distinct increase in glycemia was noted (on average 1,25 g/l) in comparison to the initial level; this increase was not however significant in the 2 observations of adenomatous hyperplasia. Following the removal of the lesion, the fall in insulinemia is also more noticeable in adenomas (reaching 75,8 per cent of the initial level) than in adenomatous hyperplasia. Nonetheless, the fall in the latter is still considerable (42,4 per cent). This examination would be the best test, excvept that the results are known only after the operation. The 7 patients operated on recovered after 2 enucleo excisions, and 5 isthmo corporal caudal splenopancreatectomies, the average post operative period reaching 4 years.
