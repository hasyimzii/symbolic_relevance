Nursing management of the patient with meningeal carcinomatosis.
The care of the patient with meningeal carcinomatosis is not unlike the care of any other patient. Despite varying symptomatology, the nurse views the patient holistically. The nurse helps the patient and family adjust to a disease process which at present, shows a gradual deterioration of function even with current therapy.
