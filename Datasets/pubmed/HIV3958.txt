Prenatal development and postnatal morbidity of newborn infants of HIV positive  mothers.
Does the maternal HIV infection itself influence fetal development and neonatal morbidity or are adverse effects related to maternal opiate and nicotine abuse? 17 neonates of HIV positive women (7 drug users) and 37 controls (17 healthy and 21 opiate exposed newborns) were examined prospectively. A discriminant analysis showed that opiate and nicotine abuse during pregnancy were associated with fetal growth retardation and neonatal morbidity, while HIV infection of the mother did not influence these parameters. Symptoms of an HIV embryopathy were not seen.
