Jugular foramen syndrome.
The jugular foramen syndrome (JFS) specifically refers to paralysis to the IX XIth cranial nerves. In a more general meaning, however, any combination of palsies affecting the last four cranial nerves has been referred to as a JFS. The anatomy of the jugular foramen and the structures which traverse it are reviewed. Two cases histories of a JFS are described; the first with chronic otitis media, and the second with a glomus tumor. A variety of neoplasms, vascular insults, infections, and trauma have been reported to cause JFS. Treatment is directed toward the underlying cause. A variety of radiological techniques which are useful in the investigation of JFS are outlined.
