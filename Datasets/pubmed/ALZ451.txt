Chemotherapy of cognitive disorders in geriatric subjects.
Many of the neurochemical changes associated with aging brain, particularly lower choline acetyltransferase and higher monoamine oxidase, occur with greater severity in senile dementia, Alzheimer's type (SDAT). These alterations correlate with neuropathologic indices, e.g., the number of senile plaques and tangles. Although many different treatment techniques have been used, most have been unsuccessful. No strong data have supported the use of stimulants, Gerovital H3, or hyperbaric oxygen. Among the vasodilators, cyclandelate and hydergine may be of value in some but not most patients. Much recent work has focused on techniques to increase acetylcholine brain concentrations. To date, precursors, such as choline, seem to have very limited value. Postsynaptic treatments, e.g., physostigmine, hold more hope for future benefit, if longer acting oral preparations are developed. Other compounds, such as ACTH, vasopressin, and piracetam, may have some value but need better definition and treatment indications. Recent discoveries on the influences of lecithin on membrane fluidity and receptor binding, may affect the focus of future pharmacologic investigation.
