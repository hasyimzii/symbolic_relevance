Examination of drug addicts on methadone treatment for HIV antibodies in the county of Frederiksborg.
In November 1988, all of the general practitioners in the County of Frederiksborg were requested to examine drug addicts on methadone therapy for HIV antibodies in December 1988 and January 1989. 81.3% of the general practitioners returned the completed form of results which they had received. Twenty eight of the drug addicts were examined for HIV antibodies. One was found to be positive, corresponding to 3.6% (95% confidence limits 0.09 18.35%). According to the official lists of patients from whom dangerous drugs were prescribed in the Danish Board of Health, 128 persons had received methadone during the two months involved. Information was thus obtained concerning 22% of the group concerned by means of this questionnaire method of investigation. This method is thus of relatively limited value for monitoring of the spread of HIV infection among drug addicts receiving methadone therapy.
