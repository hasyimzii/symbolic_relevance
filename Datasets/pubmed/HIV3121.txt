HTLV III in the tears of AIDS patients.
The human T cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III), the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), has been isolated from the tears of five AIDS patients. When combined with data from our previous study, 5 of 16 samples from patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) showed positive isolates for HTLV III from the tears. Normal control tears were negative for HTLV III. Based upon these findings, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has issued precautions to prevent any possible spread of the virus by this route. Although there is no evidence to suggest transmission of HTLV III by contact with the tears, until more is known about the possible transmissibility and infectious dose of this virus, such precautions should be taken during ophthalmic examination.
