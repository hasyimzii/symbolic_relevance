Dermatologic complications associated with administration of 2',3' dideoxycytidine in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
We describe a distinctive mucocutaneous eruption that occurred in 14 of 20 (70%)  patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection while they were being treated with a new therapeutic agent, 2'3' dideoxycytidine. A maculopapular eruption developed in these patients on day 10 or 11 of treatment. Seven of 14 patients, especially those receiving higher dose therapy, also had systemic symptoms. In addition, oral ulcers developed in 9 of 14 patients on days 4 to 6 of therapy. The occurrence of the cutaneous and oral lesions correlated with dose, route, and schedule of administration of 2'3' dideoxycytidine. In most instances the mucocutaneous lesions resolved even with continuation of therapy.
