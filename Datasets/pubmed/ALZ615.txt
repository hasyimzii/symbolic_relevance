Dementia  and adenylate kinase activity in cerebrospinal fluid.
Adenylate kinase (AK) was determined in a lumbo cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) gradient and in CSF from patients with mental deterioration. AK activity was unchanged in the gradient and different from albumin and albumin ratio (alb CSF/albumin serum), a blood brain barrier marker in the same gradient. No differences between normal pressure hydrocephalus, multiinfarct dementia and dementia of the Alzheimer type could be found with regard to adenylate kinase activity in CSF.
