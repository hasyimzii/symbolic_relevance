Chemical analysis of the glomeruli from the kidney of diabetics and subjects with chronic glomerulonephritis.
A method was established to isolate the glomeruli from the kidney fixed in formaldehyde. O Hydroxylysylglycosides and hydroxyproline in the isolated glomeruli from the kidney of normal subjects, diabetics and subjects with chronic glomerulonephritis were measured on the alkaline hydrolyzate of the glomeruli. O Hydroxylysylglycosides in 1000 glomeruli were 9.42 +/  2.68 nmoles (mean +/  S.D.) for controls, 12.92 +/  7.36 nmoles for diabetics and 12.54 +/  4.62 nmoles for subjects with chronic glomerulonephritis. Hydroxyproline in 1000 glomeruli from control, diabetics and subjects with chronic glomerulonephritis was 43.0 +/  10.7, 82.0 +/  39.3 and 52.1 +/  21.3 nmoles, respectively. Hydroxyproline in the hyalinized glomeruli from diabetics was 123.3 +/  22.4 nmoles/1000 glomeruli, and significantly increased in comparison with that in the glomeruli from chronic glomerulonephritis or control subjects.
