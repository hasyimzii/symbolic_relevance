Pulmonary non Hodgkin's lymphoma in AIDS.
Whereas extralymphatic involvement is common in lymphomas associated with HIV infection, there have been few reports of pulmonary lymphoma. In 648 cases of AIDS reported in Colorado, 40 have had non Hodgkin's lymphoma. Of these, four have had documented pulmonary involvement and are reported in detail. Clinical manifestations were nonspecific and included fever, weight loss, generalized lymphadenopathy, dyspnea, chest pain and cough. Chest roentgenograms revealed multiple nodules or interstitial infiltrates. Transbronchial biopsy failed to establish the diagnosis in all cases. Three of four patients died four to five months after appearance of pulmonary nodules; one patient with stage IE disease showed slow radiographic progression over 16 months following radiation and chemotherapy and died 18 months after appearance of pulmonary nodules. Pulmonary involvement with lymphoma should be considered in patients with HIV infection, especially if multiple nodules are seen on chest roentgenograms.
