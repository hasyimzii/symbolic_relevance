Cytomorphometric markers for uterine cancer in intermediate cells.
Precise microphotometric assessment of intermediate cells from patients with normal cervical cytology and from patients with dysplasia or carcinoma in situ shows the existence of small but consistent differences. Marker features for the presence of premalignant and malignant disease can be extracted from the cell images of "normal" appearing intermediate cells. The marker features and their diagnostic classification potential are described.
