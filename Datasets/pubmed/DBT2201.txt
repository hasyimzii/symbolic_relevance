Cadaveric renal transplantation in patients of 60 years and above.
Between 1971 and 1977, 34 patients aged 60 years and above were treated with cadaveric renal transplantation in Stockholm. The survival figures were nearly the same as for patients of the same age group that had undergone long term dialysis, with 2 year survival rates of 49 and 45%, respectively. Comparison with a younger group of transplant patients, ages 16 to 49, showed poorer patient and graft survival figures for the older patients, with 49 and 38%, respectively, after 2 years against 70 and 56% for the younger group. Complications were more frequent among the older patients, especially in regard to serious infections, heart conditions, and steroid diabetes. Irreversible rejection, on the other hand, was less common in the older group. On the basis of these findings, we intend continuing to offer renal transplantation to patients of 60 years and above. It would, moreover, seem worthwhile to try to reduce the dose of prednisolone in these patients.
