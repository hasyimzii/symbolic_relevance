Nucleus raphe dorsalis in dementia of the Alzheimer type: neurofibrillary changes and neuronal packing density.
Within the reticulate core of the brain the nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD) is a major site of predilection for the neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) in dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and, according to some studies, its primary brain stem site. In a quantitative study we have shown in six aged control brains an average of 5.2 NFT per histological section or 25.8 per mm3 and in seven age matched brains with DAT a highly significant six fold increase, respectively 35.3 NFT per histological section or 188.5 per mm3. There was no significant difference between the two groups in overall neuronal cell packing density. There was, however, a significant decrease in a subpopulation of neurons in DAT, a large polygonal neuron. Despite the prominence of the NRD as a target for NFT, the actual proportion of affected NRD cells was small, 0.35% in controls and 2.25% in DAT.
