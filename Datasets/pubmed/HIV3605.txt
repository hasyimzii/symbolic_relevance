Levels of soluble CD8 antigen and circulating immune complexes in intravenous drug abusers: relationships to HIV antibody serology.
A total of 36 intravenous drug abusers (IVDA) were studied for circulating immune complexes (CIC) and serum soluble CD8 antigen (sCD8). None had symptoms or signs of AIDS related complex or AIDS. sCD8 levels were significantly higher in 18 patients who had HIV antibody (Ab) compared with 18 patients who were HIV Ab negative (1640 +/  578 virus 804 +/  264 U/ml, p less than 0.0001). In HIV Ab+ patients but not in HIV Ab  patients, sCD8 levels significantly correlated with percentages and absolute numbers of activated CD3+DR+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (p = 0.0024 and 0.0183, respectively). Also in HIV Ab+ patients, CIC levels were significantly greater for both anti C3 binding (13.1 +/  11.1 versus 2.9 +/  3.4 micrograms/ml, p = 0.002) and C1q binding (23.5 +/  20.2 versus 6.3 +/  4.3 micrograms/ml, p = 0.001) CIC. Serum C4 concentrations were lower in the HIV Ab+ patient group (33.9 +/  10.1 versus 41.6 +/  12.4 mg/dL, p = 0.043). In the seropositive group, IgG levels were higher (2206 +/  859 versus 1615 +/  645 mg/dl) and total CD4 cell counts were lower (757 +/  344 versus 1172 +/  402 cells per mm3), but at a less significant level (p = 0.024 and 0.005, respectively), than that seen for sCD8 and C1q CIC differences. These results suggest that elevations of both the lymphocyte activation marker sCD8 and antigen nonspecific CIC characterize earlier stages of HIV infection in IVDA.
