San Diego's Alzheimer's family center.
In its four years of operation, the Alzheimer's Family Center in San Diego has demonstrated that it is possible to provide day care to a population of dementia patients which is predominantly moderate to low functioning. The program works best in a homelike atmosphere. It requires a high staff/patient ratio and must be supervised at all times by a registered nurse. Activities encourage nonintellectual skills, with an emphasis on building self esteem, enhancing social interaction, and stimulating the maximum degree of functioning possible. Family members are an integral part of the program and receive educational, counseling, and supportive services are well. Key to the success of the program is the ability to train and supervise staff in behavioral management approaches, relying primarily on non verbal communication.
