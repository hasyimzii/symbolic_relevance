Amyloid P component in human glomerular basement membrane. Abnormal patterns of immunofluorescent staining in glomerular disease.
Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a normal plasma protein and is a constituent of normal human glomerular basement membrane. Immunofluorescence with anti SAP antibody produced characteristic linear staining along the glomerular basement membrane in normal kidney. Distinctive abnormal staining patterns were seen in renal biopsy specimens from patients with diabetes, membranous glomerulonephritis, mesangiocapillary nephritis, systemic vasculitis, Goodpasture's syndrome.
