beta Galactosidase containing a human immunodeficiency virus protease cleavage site is cleaved and inactivated by human immunodeficiency virus protease.
A "cleavage cassette" specifying a decapeptide human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease cleavage site was introduced into six different locations of beta galactosidase (beta D galactoside galactohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.23) in Escherichia coli. Four of these constructs retained beta galactosidase activity despite the insertion of the cleavage cassette. Of these four constructs, one was cleaved by HIV protease, resulting in the inactivation of beta galactosidase both in vivo and in vitro. This cleavage was inhibited by pepstatin A, a known inhibitor of HIV protease. Thus, beta galactosidase has been converted into an easily assayed substrate for HIV protease. An analogous construct of beta galactosidase containing a polio protease cleavage site was cleaved likewise by polio protease, suggesting that this system may be generic for monitoring cleavage by a variety of proteases.
