Diabetic macular edema in juvenile  and adult onset diabetes.
A retrospective study of 103 patients referred because of diabetic retinopathy graded the degree of maculopathy on the basis of fluorescein angiography. Patients with juvenile onset diabetes (that is, onset before the age of 40 years), had a higher rate of neovascularization of the disk or retina at early stages of maculopathy than patients with adult onset diabetes. Greater capillary closure at each degree of maculopathy in the group with juvenile onset diabetes may explain this difference.
