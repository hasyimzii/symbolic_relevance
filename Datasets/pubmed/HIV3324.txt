Prognostic significance of the T4 lymphocyte count in patients infected with CDC Class II and III HIV.
From 1985 to 1987 101 patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were seen at our outpatient clinic and prospectively analyzed in a cohort study. We evaluated the follow up in 41 patients of CDC classes II and III with regard to the number of T helper lymphocytes (T4) and clinical progression. The patients consisted of 24 i.v. drug addicts, 11 homosexuals and 6 persons with other or multiple risk factors for HIV infection. Patients with a T4 count of less than 400/mm3 at the first visit did not differ significantly with regard to development of AIDS from those with a count of greater than 400/mm3 after a mean follow up of approximately 1 year. The course of the infection for the individual patient was extremely varied and not predictable by the T4 value. We conclude that the number of the T4 lymphocytes is of no help in assessment of prognosis in the individual patient of CDC classes II and III.
