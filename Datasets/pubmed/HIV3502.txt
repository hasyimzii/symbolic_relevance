Morbidity at an Amsterdam inner city clinic in relation to drug use.
In a small clinic in a deprived area of Amsterdam, a city with a high incidence of recreational drug use, sexually transmitted diseases and social problems, the association between drug use and disease was notable. Frequent presentation with sexually transmitted diseases, repeated trauma, unexplained recurrence of infections of the skin and respiratory tract, or severe dental caries may alert the physician to the possibility of recreational drug use and with it an increased possibility of HIV related illness. The group of drug users staying permanently in the city appeared to be ageing, without being replenished by youngsters. Very young drug users were mainly 'drug tourists' from neighbouring countries who were without medical insurance or money.
