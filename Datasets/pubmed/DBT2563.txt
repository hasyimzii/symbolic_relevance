Familial insulin resistance with pineal hyperplasia: metabolic studies and effect of hypophysectomy.
Mendenhall's syndrome comprises insulin resistant diabetes, pineal hyperplasia, and various somatic anomalies. A boy with this condition now aged 12 years is reported; a similarly affected sibling died aged 7.8 years. Hypophysectomy has been of short term benefit, but the problems of insulin resistance persist. On the basis of monocyte binding studies it seems likely that in this condition there is an inherited deficiency of insulin receptors.
