Biochemical and biological characterization of lymphocyte regulatory molecules. V. Identification of an interleukin 2 producing human leukemia T cell line.
To isolate a stable tumor cell line capable of producing human interleukin 2 (IL 2; formerly referred to as T cell growth factor), 16 human T and B leukemia cell lines were screened for constitutive and mitogen stimulated IL 2 production. We found that the T cell leukemia line designated Jurkat FHCRC produced > 200 U/ml of IL 2 activity after a 24 h stimulation with T cell mitogens. Peak mitogen induced IL 2 activity was found in supernates harvested from 24 h Jurkat FHCRC cell cultures stimulated with either 1% phytohemagglutinin or 20 microgram/ml concanavalin A. Addition of the fatty acid derivative phorbol myristate acetate to mitogen stimulated cultures increased Jurkat FHCRC IL 2 production to concentrations > 400 U/ml. IL 2 activity observed in such cases represented between 100  300 times that produced in conventional cultures of mitogen  or alloantigen stimulated normal human peripheral blood or splenic lymphocytes. Jurkat FHCRC derived conditioned medium demonstrated equal capacity to promote the sustained in vitro proliferation of either murine or human activated T cell lines confirming the ability of Jurkat FHCRC cells to produce human IL 2. These studies identify a new source of human IL 2 and establish a valuable reagent for the isolation and further molecular characterization of this immunoregulatory molecule.
