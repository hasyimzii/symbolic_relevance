LAV/HTLV III antibodies in patients treated with intravenous gammaglobulins.
The test sera from 50 patients treated with intravenous gammaglobulins (IVG) were examined for LAV/HTLV III antibody by ELISA tests in order to evaluate the risk of transmission of LAV/HTLV III virus via administration of IVG. The three ELISA positive sera were negative for the antibody by both indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot assay (WBA). Thus, all of the test sera were negative for LAV/HTLV III antibody. Two of the ELISA positive/IFA negative/WBA negative samples had HLA DR4 antibodies causing positive ELISA results.
