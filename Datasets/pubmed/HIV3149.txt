Squamous carcinoma of the anus in young homosexual men with T helper cell depletion.
Two cases of squamous carcinoma of the anus in white homosexual men aged 36 and 47 years are reported, each with a short history of rapidly enlarging perianal lesions. Immunological studies showed that both men had pronounced T helper lymphocyte depletion, and antibody to human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III) was detected in both patients. In addition one patient had a long history of wart virus infection of the anal canal. The diminished cellular immunity associated with HTLV III may have been responsible for the development of the squamous carcinoma, either directly or by its association with human papilloma virus infection.
