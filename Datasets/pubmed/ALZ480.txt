Reversible steroid dementia in patients without steroid psychosis.
Six patients developed dementia like cognitive changes that appeared to result from administration of steroid medications. Four of the patients never showed symptoms of steroid psychosis; the remaining two continued to show steroid dementia well after their steroid psychoses had resolved. The dementia was characterized by deficits in memory retention, attention, concentration, mental speed and efficiency, and occupational performance. All six patients eventually recovered normal mental status following discontinuation or reduction of steroid medications. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine the prevalence and nature of the syndrome.
