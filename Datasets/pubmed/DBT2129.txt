Studies of hyperlipidemia in drug induced diabetic rats by high performance liquid chromatography.
A hyperlipidemic condition is often associated with diabetes. The possibility that specific serum lipids (i.e., individual triglycerides or cholesterol esters) may be altered in the diabetic state was investigated. Serum lipids from both controls and streptozotocin  and alloxan treated rats were separated into approximately twenty chromtographic fractions by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; a number of individual triglycerides and cholesterol esters were identified. The methodology described allowed subtle changes in individual lipid components to be detected. Only minor variations in the cholesterol and cholesterol ester fractions were observed between the control and diabetic samples. While not uniform throughout, elevations in the triglyceride fractions occurred in the diabetics. Also, differences in triglyceride content were found to exist between the groups of streptozotocin  and alloxan treated animals.
