Postmenopausal endometriosis.
The frequency of postmenopausal endometriosis (ovarian endometriosis and adenomyosis) was 2.2%. The mean of the menopausal ages in 11 patients with ovarian endometriosis was 50.3 yr and the average time elapsed since menopause, 7.3 yr. The corresponding values in 8 patients with adenomyosis were 52.1 and 8.8 yr. Carcinoma was a common associated finding in patients with ovarian endometriosis. Increased estrogen activity was observed more frequently in patients with adenomyosis than in those with ovarian endometriosis. Only one of the patients had received estrogen therapy. Hormone producing tumors in the ovaries or adrenal glands were not confirmed. 70% of the patients were obese and the signs of increased estrogen activity could be explained by extraglandular estrogen formation.
