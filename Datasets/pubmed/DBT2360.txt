Somatogenic receptors of rat liver: regulation by insulin.
Somatogenic (i.e. GH) receptors have been studied on liver microsomal membranes from male and female rats. Tracer bovine GH was displaced from its binding sites by GHs of various species, but was displaced only weakly by PRLs. Specific bovine GH binding was 3.5 fold higher to female rat liver membranes than to membranes from males. Streptozotocin induced diabetes significantly reduced binding, by 80% in females and 50% in males, while insulin therapy to normalize weight gain reversed the decrease in binding. Competitive binding curves were consistent with two independent classes of binding site: low affinity sites with K equal to 0.5 nm 1 in both sexes, and high affinity sites with K equal to 12.1 nm 1 in males and 21.4 nm 1 in females (P less than 0.001). The addition of excess ovine PRL caused a substantial loss of high affinity binding with little loss in the low affinity region, suggesting a weak somatogenic role for ovine PRL. In diabetic animals, low affinity sites were unchanged from normal, while high affinity sites were decreased in number, with no change in affinity, and restored on insulin therapy. Serum immunoreactive rat GH levels were the same in normal and diabetic, male and female animals. These studies suggest that the apparent hepatic resistance to GH seen in diabetes when liver somatomedin release is low despite normal serum GH might be explained by the loss of GH receptors in this condition.
