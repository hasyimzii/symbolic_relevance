Morphine intrathecally   in postoperative and cancer induced pain (author's transl).
Morphine 2 mg was injected directly into the intrathecal space in 33 patients. In the nonoperative group (group I) morphine was given with 2 ml saline solution; in the operative group (group II, 21 patients) morphine was given with 2 ml 10% glucose solution immediately before induction of anaesthesia. The onset of pain relief occurred after 12 to 35 min and the duration of analgesia was 14 and 18 35 min and the duration of analgesia was 14 and 48 hours. In group II we observed in respiratory depression 3 cases and in one case bladder insufficiency after morphine. In group I bladder insufficiency occurred in 2 cases. The disturbed bladder function recovered spontaneously in a few hours after morphine application. Respiratory depression was treated successfully with naloxone.
