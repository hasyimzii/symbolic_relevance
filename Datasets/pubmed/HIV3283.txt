T lymphocyte subpopulations in anti HIV negative drug dependent patients with intravenous abuse.
In the group of patients studied by us, we found a slight disturbance of the balance between immunoregulatory T helper/inductor lymphocytes and cytotoxic T suppressor lymphocytes which is usually characterised by a 2 to 1 ratio. This disturbance was due to the presence of an absolutely and relatively enhanced quantity of T suppressor cells, by which the relation of these T cell subsets to each other was slightly lower than in the normal controls. The average ratio was 1.37 and was pathologically reduced in 19% of the patients. Activation and increase in the number of T suppressor cells in conjunction with a relative lymphocytosis are probably less due to a directly drug induced effect than to an adequate immunoreaction to increased antigen stimuli such as infections with hepatitis B virus, viruses of the herpes group and other viral pathogens.
