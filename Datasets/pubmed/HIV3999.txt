Human immunodeficiency virus 1 glycoproteins gp120 and gp160 specifically inhibit the CD3/T cell antigen receptor phosphoinositide transduction pathway.
The interference of the recombinant HIV 1 glycoproteins gp160 and gp120 with the  CD3/T cell antigen receptor (TcR) mediated activation process has been investigated in the CD4+ diphtheria toxoid specific human P28D T cell clone. Both glycoproteins clearly inhibit the T cell proliferation induced in an antigen presenting cell (APC) free system by various cross linked monoclonal antibodies specific for the CD3 molecule or the TcR alpha chain (up to 80% inhibition). Biochemical studies further demonstrate that exposure of the T cell clone to both glycoproteins (gps) specifically inhibits the CD3/TcR phospholipase C (PLC) transduction pathway, without affecting the CD3/TcR cell surface expression. Thus, inositol phosphate production, phosphatidic acid turnover, intracellular free calcium, and intracellular pH increase induced by CD3/TcR specific MAbs are specifically impaired in gps treated P28D T cells. Addition of purified soluble CD4 prevents binding of gps to T cells and overcomes all observed inhibitions. Maximal inhibitions are obtained for long term exposure of the T cell clone to gps (16 h). No early effect of gps is observed. By contrast, gp160 and gp120 fail to suppress the CD2 triggered functional and biochemical P28D T cell responses. These results demonstrate that, in addition to their postulated role in the alteration of the interaction between CD4 on T lymphocytes and MHC class II molecules on APC, soluble HIV 1 envelope glycoproteins may directly and specifically impair the CD3/TcR mediated activation of PLC in uninfected T cells via the CD4 molecule.
