Fluid collections ultrasonically simulating urinary bladder.
Large cystic masses or fluid collections may closely simulate the appearance of the urinary bladder on ultrasound examination. Because of this potential error in identification we retrospectively evaluated 100 cystic pelvic masses and fluid collections to determine how readily the urinary bladder was identified as distinct from the mass or fluid collection. Factors contributing to this confusion and techniques to avoid this potential pitfall are discussed.
