Monoclonal antibodies to Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles. 2. Demonstration of a common antigenic determinant between ANT and neurofibrillary degeneration in progressive supranuclear palsy.
Neurofibrillary degeneration is an argyrophilic intraneuronal lesion found in several unrelated neurologic conditions. The relationship between different types of neurofibrillary tangles is investigated with two monoclonal antibodies raised against Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles (anti ANT). Using the peroxidase antiperoxidase technique, the authors demonstrate that neurofibrillary tangles of progressive supranuclear palsy, containing 15 nm straight filaments, share an antigenic determinant with ANTs. Ultrastructural studies localize the antigenic determinant to filamentous elements in the parakarya. The determinant is not present in normal brain, aluminum induced experimental tangles in the rabbit, Lewy bodies, Hirano bodies, or axonal filamentous inclusions of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and giant axonal neuropathy. It is, however, present in ANTs regardless of the pathologic condition in which they are found, including Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, and postencephalitic Parkinson's disease.
