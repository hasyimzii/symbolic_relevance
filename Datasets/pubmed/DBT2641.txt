Enkephalin effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and baroreceptor reflex.
The cardiovascular effects of opioid peptides have been studied. Leucine enkephalin (Leu ENK) produced blood pressure (BP) increases following administration into the lateral brain ventricles (i.v.t.), into the cisterna magna (i.c.i.), and following intravenous (i.v.) administration. Heart rate (HR) increases were observed following all routes of administration (threshold for BP and HR effects at 0.3 nmole, maximum at 360 nmoles). The cardiovascular effects were independent of generalized seizures, which may occur at higher doses of enkephalins (ENK). D alanine enkephalin (D Ala ENK) attenuated the vagal component of the baroreceptor reflex in cats. This was indicated by the findings that HR did not decrease following D Ala ENK induced BP increases and that the compensatory decreases in HR following i.v. pressor doses of angiotensin II (ANG II) were markedly attenuated in cats treated with i.v.t. D Ala ENK. Naloxone inhibited the BP and HR effects following i.c.i. and i.v., but not following i.v.t., administration of Leu ENK. The i.v.t. Leu ENK effect were inhibited by beta adrenergic receptor blockade. Bratteboro rats homozygous for hereditary diabetes insipidus with total absence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) synthesis responded with BP decreases following i.v.t. Leu ENK, while BP increases were observed in control Long Evans rats. Blood pressure increases to i.v.t. Leu ENK were markedly greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the stroke prone strain (SHR sp) than in normotensive control rats; SHR sp exhibit a humoral pattern of increased ADH, ACTH, and catecholamines, presumably due to central peptidergic stimulation. The known effects of opioid peptides on these hormones and the observed cardiovascular responses suggest a possible participation of this peptide system in the maintenance of high BP in the SHR sp.
