Computer tomographic localisation in primary aldosteronism. Comparison with adrenal scintigraphy (author's transl).
13 patients with verified primary aldosteronism (unilateral adrenal adenoma = 10, bilateral idiopathic hyperplasia = 3) underwent examination by CT and 131J cholesterol scintigraphy. CT scan can successfully employed for localization of unilateral adenoma exceeding 10 mm in diameter. Small lesions and hyperplasia are rare CT findings. The value of 131J cholesterol scintigraphy for differentiation of the two main subgroups of primary aldosteronism  adenoma and hyperplasia  is limited. In our experience both non invasive methods are helpful to avoid misleading interpretation. In controversial cases bilateral adrenal venous blood sampling by catheterization is mandatory.
