Growth hormone, prolactin and thyrotrophin responses to thyrotrophin releasing hormone in diabetic patients.
Growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL) and thyrotrophin (TSH) responses to thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) were studied in 15 insulin dependent diabetic patients. Basal plasma GH levels were raised above 5 mu./l in 6 patients and following the injection of TRH there was a significant rise in plasma GH levels in 9. The mean rise in plasma GH from basal to peak values was significant in the group as a whole (P < 0.01). Basal PRL and TSH levels were normal and rose normally in response to TRH. GH release may be qualitatively abnormal in some diabetics and any such loss of specificity of GH releasing mechanisms would further contribute to the raised GH levels found in many diabetics which would be of importance if GH is a factor in the aetiology of diabetic microangiopathy.
