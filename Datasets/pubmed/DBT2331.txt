Glycohemoglobin determinations in normal pregnancy and in insulin dependent diabetics.
Minor components of adult hemoglobin (A1a,b, and c) are known to increase in the  presence of sustained elevations of maternal blood glucose. This study demonstrates the correlation between glycosylated hemoglobin components and the usual shorter term indices of diabetic control. In addition, a correlation was noted between glycosylated hemoglobin values and birth weight and placental weight. Glycohemoglobin values serve as an accurate index of long term control of blood sugar and are helpful in assessing the efficacy of the treatment plan.
