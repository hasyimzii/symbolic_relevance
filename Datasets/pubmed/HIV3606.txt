Interferon gamma is associated with the surface of the human immunodeficiency virus and binds to the gag gene product p17.
Purified HIV 1 antigen preparations produced in cell culture were found to contain interferon gamma (IFN gamma). Electron microscopic examination of HIV 1 released by H9 cells, a cell line found to produce IFN gamma, showed the presence of this molecule on the surface of the virus particle. The HIV 1 protein p17 was found to bind IFN gamma by a solid phase radioimmunoassay. The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by Western blot analysis. This finding opens new questions about the biologic role of IFN gamma itself and of its interaction with HIV.
