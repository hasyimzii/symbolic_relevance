Progesterone receptors: saturation analysis by a solid phase hydroxylapatite adsorption technique.
An assay for cytoplasmic progesterone receptor is described in which receptor is  bound to hydroxylapatite and is washed before saturation analysis. Using 3H progesterone as ligand, the assay yields lower, more reproducible nonspecific binding than is obtained with dextran coated charcoal techniques and may provide a clinically useful method of measuring progesterone receptor in breast carcinoma. Nuclear progesterone receptors can also be determined by the same technique.
