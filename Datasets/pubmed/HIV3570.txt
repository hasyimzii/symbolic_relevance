Cross activation of the Rex proteins of HTLV I and BLV and of the Rev protein of  HIV 1 and nonreciprocal interactions with their RNA responsive elements.
The Rex regulatory proteins of human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV I) and bovine leukemia virus (BLV), and the Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1), promote the cytoplasmic accumulation and translation of viral messenger mRNAs encoding structural proteins. Rev and Rex act through cis acting elements on the viral RNA; these elements are named Rev  and Rex responsive elements, or RRE and RXRE, respectively. We show that the Rex proteins of HTLV I and BLV are interchangeable, but only the Rex protein of HTLV I can substitute for Rev of HIV 1. Rex of HTLV I and Rev of HIV 1 appear to act on RRE by similar mechanisms. Rev of HIV 1 does not act on the RXRE of HTLV I or BLV. The nonreciprocal action of Rev and Rex suggests that these factors interact directly with the cis acting RNA elements of the two viruses.
