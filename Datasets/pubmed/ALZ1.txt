Reduced amounts of immunoreactive somatostatin in the temporal cortex in senile dementia of Alzheimer type.
Post mortem brain tissue from 15 patients dying with a diagnosis of senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) was compared with tissue obtained from 16 control patients at routine post mortem. A significant fall in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was observed in the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala of the SDAT cases and was maximal in the temporal cortex. The fall in ChAT activity observed in the temporal cortex was accompanied by a significant reduction (47%) in immunoreactive somatostatin.
