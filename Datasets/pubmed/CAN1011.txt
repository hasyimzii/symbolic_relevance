Lithium carbonate in the treatment of drug induced leukopenia in patients with solid tumors.
The authors report on the first part of an ongoing controlled trial (52 cases) on the evaluation of the effectiveness of Li2CO3 treatment of drug induced leukopenia in patients with solid tumors. The results indicate that treatment with 750 mg/day per os of Li2CO3 for 7 days is capable of raising the leukocyte count to a highly significant extent, without serious side effects. The leukocytosis is due to an increase in neutrophil granulocytes.
