Fine analysis of intrathecally synthesized anti HIV IgG1 4 by peptide mapping.
ELISAs utilizing HIV derived synthetic peptides as antigen were used to analyze serum and CSF IgG1 4 from 15 HIV infected patients. Intrathecally synthesized IgG1 4 reactive to one or several HIV derived peptides were detectable in 12 of 15 patients. Intrathecally synthesized anti peptide IgG was more common in patients with neurological symptoms than in those without. CSF reactivity not paralleled by serum reactivity was detected to HIV peptides in 4 patients. IgG1 4 to gp41 was relatively more frequent in the CNS than IgG1 4 to gag. Intrathecal IgG synthesis to the gp120 peptide was not detected in any patient. The anti peptide responses were dominated by IgG1. Intrathecal IgG2 and 4 synthesis was found in 2 and 5 patients, respectively. IgG3 synthesis intrathecally was not detected in any of the patients. ELISAs detecting IgG1 4 to HIV derived synthetic peptides are feasible to analyze the fine specificities of intrathecal IgG. The mapping of idiotypes and isotypes of IgG synthesized in the CNS will increase the possibilities of elucidating B cell regulation in the CNS and which viral components evoke immune responses.
