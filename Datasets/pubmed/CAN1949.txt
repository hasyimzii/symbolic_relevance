Differences in the properties of specific T suppressors and cytotoxic T lymphocytes immune to H 2 complex antigens.
Intravenous immunization of mice with a large dose of gamma irradiated allogenic  spleen cells gives rise to specific suppressor T cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL). However, being optimal form suppressor T cell induction, these conditions of immunization are not conducive to identification of CTL unless they are enriched by elution from the allogenic target monolayer. Unlike CTL, specific suppressor T cells are highly susceptible to gamma irradiation while their precursors differ from those of CTL by high susceptibility to cyclophosphamide and hydrocortisone.
