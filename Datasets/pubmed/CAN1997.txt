Small cell carcinoma of the lung.
Prospects for the patient with small cell carcinoma of the lung have been partially turned around during the past decade. This dramatic achievement remains very incomplete, but it continues to gather momentum and seems to carry promise of greater advance in the future. An essential feature of the new approach to treatment is that it depends on cooperative and interdisciplinary effort; in all probability, increasing cooperation will be necessary for future progress. We will attempt to review here the current approaches to the understanding and management of this disease, as they may be of concern to surgeons, and to try to define the areas of failure and controversy.
