Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (Lewandowsky Lutz): the revived report of a case  seen in 1944.
A Japanese girl, born of a consanguineous marriage, believed to have epidermodysplasia verruciformis, lost all of her wart like lesions within a week after one was biopsied, and was then considered to have actually just had warts. It was only in retrospect, years afterward, that it was realized that the truly wart like nature of the lesions did not exclude epidermodysplasia verruciformis at all. The case is therefore being belatedly reported, as a reminiscence. Note: This case report, originally written in 1944, was never published because, at that time, the case was considered to be of no more interest than any case of extensive flat warts. In the light of increased knowledge, it seems that it was indeed a case of epidermodysplasia verruciformis; and so it is presented here as a curiosity, and because the seemingly spontaneous recovery within a week following biopsy is a matter of particular interest.
