Computerisation of diabetic clinic records.
A simple system for putting diabetic records on a computer file is achieved by using stationery that combines the usual handwritten records (not computerised) with the minimum of essential data suitable for punching on to computer tape. The record may be brought up to date at a selected time time interval. This simple, cheap system has been in use in a busy clinic for six years. The information on about 8000 diabetics now held in the computer file is used chiefly to help research by creating registers of patients with specified characteristics, such as treatment, heredity complications, and pregnancy. A complete up to date index of the entire clinic population is always available, and routine clinic statistics are returned every six months.
