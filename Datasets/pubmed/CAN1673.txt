Aspects of hypertension of endocrine and adrenal origin.
The authors discuss the results of observation of 269 patients with adrenal arterial hypertension 247 of whom underwent operation. The malignant hypertension syndrome developed in 39% of the patients. It is presumed that its development was caused by the combination of adrenal and renal affections as well as by specific hormonal shifts: relative norepinephrine hyperproduction and reduced intensity of catecholamine metabolism. In all groups of the patients with the malignant hypertension syndrome, a higher daily excretion of aldosterone and increased blood renin activity were also found. The character of the drug therapy and the late results of surgical treatment are discussed. A new variant of hyperaldosteronism, dexamethasone inhibited form of aldosteroma, is described.
