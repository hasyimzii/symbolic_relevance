In vivo interaction of anti cancer drugs with misonidazole or metronidazole: cyclophosphamide and BCNU.
The addition of misonidazole (MISO) or metronidazole (METRO) to treatment with cyclophosphamide (CY) increased delay to regrowth of 2 experimental tumours. The effect was observed for large an small tumours, was present for doses of MISO that are ineffective for killing hypoxic cells, and required that it be given with, or shortly before CY. Mice receiving combined treatment had more weight loss and myelosuppression than those receiving CY alone, and the Therapeutic Index was lower. MISO caused a marked increase in growth delay when combined with BCNU to treat the KHT sarcoma. This effect was observed for small and large tumours, required simultaneous administration of drugs, and also led to increased host toxicity. There was no therapeutic advantage from combined treatment. Survival of aerobic or anoxic Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was assessed after exposure in vitro to serum from mice that had received CY or BCNU alone. MISO alone, or combined treatment. Results of these experiments suggest that (1) MISO delays the excretion or breakdown of active metabolites of CY, and (2) at a dose that does not kill hypoxic cells, it may selectively "sensitize" hypoxic cells (but not aerobic cells) to the action of BCNU. The presence of other undetermined interactions of BCNU and MISO is inferred from the increased toxicity to (aerobic) normal tissue. Misonidazole or metronidazole should be used with caution in patients who are receiving BCNU or cyclophosphamide.
