A longitudinal EEG study of mild senile dementia of Alzheimer type: changes at 1  year and at 2.5 years.
This longitudinal study of resting EEGs compared patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) and healthy controls at 3 times of testing over a 2.5 year period. Measures included the mean EEG frequency as well as the percentage of power in alpha, beta, theta, and delta frequency bands obtained from power spectral analysis. The values from occipital to vertex derivations were averaged for the left and right hemispheres. In healthy older adults delta increased, and both beta and mean frequency decreased over the study period; there was no significant change in theta or alpha. In the SDAT group, all 5 EEG measures changed significantly; there were increases in delta and theta, and decreases in beta, alpha and mean frequency. Theta percentage power distinguished between all 4 stages of dementia (control, mild, moderate and severe). Other EEG measures discriminated only at certain stages. In the mild stage of SDAT theta, beta and mean frequency were already different from control values. In the moderate stage, these differences persisted, and alpha became different. Delta was the last to change, and in the present small sample of those with severe SDAT the difference had not yet reached significance.
