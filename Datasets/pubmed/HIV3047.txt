Isolation of HTLV III from cerebrospinal fluid and neural tissues of patients with neurologic syndromes related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
We conducted virus isolation studies on 56 specimens from the nervous system of 45 patients in order to determine whether human T cell lymphotropic virus Type III (HTLV III) is directly involved in the pathogenesis of the neurologic disorders frequently encountered in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the AIDS related complex. We recovered HTLV III from at least one specimen from 24 of 33 patients with AIDS related neurologic syndromes. In one patient, HTLV III was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid during acute aseptic meningitis associated with HTLV III seroconversion. HTLV III was also isolated from cerebrospinal fluid from six of seven patients with AIDS or its related complex and unexplained chronic meningitis. In addition, of 16 patients with AIDS related dementia, 10 had positive cultures for HTLV III in cerebrospinal fluid, brain tissue, or both. Furthermore, we cultured HTLV III from the spinal cord of a patient with myelopathy and from the sural nerve of a patient with peripheral neuropathy. These findings suggest that HTLV III is neurotropic, is capable of causing acute meningitis, is responsible for AIDS related chronic meningitis and dementia, and may be the cause of the spinal cord degeneration and peripheral neuropathy in AIDS and AIDS related complex.
