Visual processing deficits as assessed by spatial frequency contrast sensitivity  and backward masking in normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease.
Visual functions of patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type were compared with those of young people and age matched controls. Visual acuity and spatial frequency contrast sensitivity did not differ significantly between Alzheimer patients and normal elderly subjects, although both were impaired in comparison with young subjects. Alzheimer patients required more time than ageing controls to identify letters and were susceptible to the interfering effects of a backward pattern mask on letter recognition over a longer interval. The spatial extent over which the pattern mask was effective, as well as the time interval over which a homogeneous mask interfered with letter recognition, were equivalent in normal old people and Alzheimer patients. In all the masking tasks, young people performed better than the old. It is suggested that Alzheimer's disease affects later central visual functions more than early relatively peripheral ones.
