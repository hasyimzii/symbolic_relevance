NMR imaging in dementia states. A diagnostic and quantitative study.
Spin lattic relaxation times (T1) and proton density derived from proton nuclear  magnetic resonance imaging data are measured in elderly patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) and multi infarct dementia (MID) and the results compared with elderly controls. T1 values of the cerebral white matter are increased in the dementia groups and there is a statistical correlation with severity. Patients with SDAT have significantly differing proton density measures in cerebral white matter from those with MID. The potential value of these results are discussed together with the possible application to identify regional areas of damage.
