Infected gangrene. A serious complication of peripheral vasopressin administration.
Vasopressin (Pitressin) infusion through peripheral veins is a commonly used modality for control of bleeding esophageal varices. In this report we describe the development of infected gangrene at the site of accidental vasopressin infiltration in a patient with diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis and bleeding esophageal varices. Among the explanations for the development of gangrene are: 1. continuous intravenous administration; 2. diabetic peripheral vascular disease; 3. mechanical compression of extravasated fluid in a closed space. No antagonist has been clinically proven to reverse the vasoconstrictive effects of vasopressin.
