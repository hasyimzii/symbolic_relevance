Azidothymidine inhibits mitogen stimulated growth and DNA repair in human peripheral lymphocytes.
Until now, 3' Azido 3' deoxythymidine (AZT) is the most widely used drug in AIDS  therapy, but the positive anti HIV effect of the drug is often accompanied by severe side effects such as bone marrow suppression. In the present study, the effect of AZT on UV induced DNA strand break rejoining and on phytohemagglutinin stimulated growth of lymphocytes from 7 healthy volunteers has been examined, and inhibitory effects of the drug was observed at therapeutic concentrations, i.e. 1 10 uM AZT.
