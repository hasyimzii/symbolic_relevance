Monoamine metabolites in human cerebrospinal fluid. HPLC/ED method.
Catecholamines and indolealkylamines are of clinical interest in neurological and psychiatric disorders. We measured 3 methoxy DOPA, 3 methoxy 4 hydroxyphenylglycol, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, tryptophan, 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid and homovanillic acid in human cerebrospinal fluid with a simple, sensitive , inexpensive, rapid and accurate procedure using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an electrochemical detector. Patients with Parkinson's disease have a decrement in homovanillic acid that is reversed by treatment with L 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine. After this medication, 3 methoxy DOPA is measurable in cerebrospinal fluid. Patients with depression show a decrease in serotonin turnover expressed by diminished 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid content in cerebrospinal fluid. Depressed patients also show low levels of tryptophan. Monoamine metabolites are augmented in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
