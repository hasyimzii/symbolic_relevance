Results of photocoagulation in diabetic retinopathy after long term follow up.
Seventy three diabetes with retinopathy, in whom one eye was treated by photocoagulation, and the other was left untreated, were followed up for 9 to 11 years. Visual acuity, visual field, dark adaptation curves, and intraocular pressure were recorded; biomicroscopy and photography of the fundus were carried out. Severe visual loss (<0.1) was noted in 4% of the treated and in 25% of the untreated eyes. Minor, subjectively unnoticed, scotomas were found at visual field examination in 18 of 40 treated eyes. Dark adaptation curves showed abnormal values both in the treated and in the untreated eyes, without any recordable difference. No contra indicating long term complications of the photocoagulation treatment could be demonstrated.
