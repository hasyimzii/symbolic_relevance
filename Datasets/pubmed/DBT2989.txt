Levels of dynorphin (1 13) immunoreactivity in rat neurointermediate pituitaries  are concomitantly altered with those of leucine enkephalin and vasopressin in response to various endocrine manipulations.
The levels of dynorphin (1 13), leucine enkephalin, beta endorphin and vasopressin immunoreactivity (ir DYN, ir 1 ENK, ir beta END, ir VP) have been determined in the anterior and in the neurointermediate lobes of the pituitary of rats subjected to a variety of manipulations. Dehydration of rats by 5 days enforced inhibition of a 2% solution of NaCl resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of ir DYN, ir 1 ENK and ir VP, but not in those of ir beta END in the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary. In contrast, substitution of drinking water by a solution containing 20 microgram/ml dexamethasone for 5 days produced a significant increase in the neurointermediate pituitary content of ir DYN, ir 1 ENK and ir VP, whereas levels of ir beta END remained unaffected. This treatment, however, resulted in a significant fall in the ir beta END content of the adenopituitary without changing levels of ir DYN in this structure. Adrenalectomy was associated with a significant decrease in the ir DYN, ir VP and ir 1 ENK content of the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary and a pronounced elevation in the ir beta END but not ir DYN content of the adenohypophysis. These observations are indicative that the regulation mechanisms of the functional state of particular endorphins differ between the anterior and neurointermediate lobes of the pituitary. The concomitant alterations in levels of ir DYN, ir 1 ENK and ir VP detected suggest that a common or similar mechanism of regulation may exist for these peptides. A common biosynthetic origin, however, appears to be unlikely, since Brattleboro rats which are unable to synthesize vasopressin possess unchanged ir DYN  and ir 1 ENK  levels in the pituitary.
