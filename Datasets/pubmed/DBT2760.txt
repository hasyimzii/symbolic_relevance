Photocoagulation in proliferating diabetic retinitis (author's transl).
Results obtained in 64 patients with proliferating diabetic retinitis (PDR) are reported and discussed; photocoagulation was performed between 1970 and 1977, and regular check ups were carried out for more than six months. Twenty five patients were treated unilaterally and 39 bilaterally. Of the various photocoagulation techniques peripheral ablation with the xenon coagulator, in some cases in combination with the argon laser, has proven to be the most successful form of therapy at present. In 70% of the eyes the condition was alleviated or arrested. The number of patients blinded in both eyes was minimized at 12.5% for the total collective and 14.3% for patients observed for more than five years. The indications, limitations and side effects of photocoagulation are discussed, and the prognosis for PDR is presented as a function of the degree of severity of the retinitis and the occurrence of vitreous hemorrhages.
