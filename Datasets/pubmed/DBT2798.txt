Body weight change in relation to incidence of ischemic heart disease and change  in risk factors for ischemic heart disease.
A representative population sample of middle aged women was studied in 1968 1969  and re studied in 1974 1975. A total of 1302 women participated in both studies (80.3% of the initial sample). A statistically significant correlation was found between weight gain and the incidences of angina pectoris and arterial hypertension. A statistically significant correlation was also found between cessation of smoking and weight gain. Regression analysis revealed statistically significant changes of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting blood glucose, serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides and serum uric acid with changes in body weight.
