Biochemical characterization of human melanoma cell surfaces: dissection with monoclonal antibodies.
This report describes the structures of three distinct human melanoma surface antigens detected by monoclonal anti melanoma antibodies. One antigen, expressed on all melanoma cells and on certain astrocytoma cells but not on any other kind of normal or tumor cell tested, has been shown to consist of our associated polypeptide chains. A second antigen expressed on many but not all melanomas has been identified as the antigenic product of the HLA D locus, the DR antigen. A third protein antigen is not found on any normal cell tested but occurs on some, but not all, tumors of various origins.
