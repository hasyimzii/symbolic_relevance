Ischaemic optic neuropathy  a combined mechanism.
A clinical pathological study is reported of a patient who developed bilateral ischaemic optic neuropathy following a massive gastrointestinal haemorrhage with associated vascular complications in watershed areas of the myocardium and brain. Additional factors of giant cell arteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis contributed to the unique pathology. The distribution of infarction to the optic nerve has been related to known studies on the blood supply of the optic nerve.
