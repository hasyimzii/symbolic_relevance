Total duodenopancreatectomy in chronic relapsing pancreatitis: report of 18 cases.
In 1976 1979 a total duodenopancreatectomy was employed in 18 patients with chronic relapsing pancreatitis. Indication for operation in all patients was due to pain long year lasting, and resistant to therapy efforts. Indication was also given, for we recorded in 15 patients loss of weight of 15 kg on an average, because eating was very painful for these patients. 4 patients were jaundiced, in another two patients we suspected a pancreasneoplasm preoperatively. For ten patients we observed a postoperative period without any complication, two patients died postoperatively. Later on patients were mostly affected by diabetes, which could not be controlled at all, while maldigestion could be treated easily. Therefore total duodenopancreatectomy should not be the general operative treatment in chronic pancreatitis and should rather be reserved for special cases.
