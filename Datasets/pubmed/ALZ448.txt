CT study in dementia  today and in the future.
The role of CT in the diagnosis of senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) is discussed. Research data show that, although SDAT is closely correlated with brain atrophy (sulcal and ventricular dilatation) there is a significant overlap with the normal elderly population: that is to say, within the demented population, CT changes correlate only weakly with cognitive impairment. However, taken together with other clinical indices, CT can be useful both for the assessment of SDAT and the exclusion of treatable lesions. Newer computer methods of analysis and technical improvements hold out hope for future clinical and research advances in this area.
