The intrathoracic technique, application, and merits of the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap are presented by the single stage repair of a presumed postirradiation tracheoesophageal fistula. This etiology, if indeed true, has not been demonstrated, nor has this extension to the flap's many possible uses been previously described.
