Immunodeficiency in HIV 2 infection: a community study from Guinea Bissau.
In a community study in Guinea Bissau, West Africa, 47 HIV 2 seropositive cases and 87 matched controls were evaluated immunologically using immuno alkaline phosphatase linked to avidin biotin complex for the assessment of CD4 and CD8 status. HIV 2 seropositive individuals had significantly lower total numbers of CD4 cells and CD4/CD8 ratios, 38% having a total number of CD4 cells less than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l and 36% having a CD4/CD8 ratio less than or equal to 0.8. Total numbers of CD4 cells less than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l or CD4/CD8 ratio less than or equal to 0.8 were found in 53% of the HIV 2 seropositives compared with 11% among controls [odds ratio (OR) = 7.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.1 17.1]. Lymphadenopathy was significantly more frequent among HIV 2 seropositives than among controls (OR = 3.4; 95% Cl: 1.5 7.6). HIV 2 seropositives with lymphadenopathy had significantly fewer lymphocytes (P = 0.008) and lower total CD4 (P = 0.029) and total CD8 number (P = 0.011) than HIV 2 seropositives without lymphadenopathy. This study indicates that HIV 2 has a significant immunosuppressive effect.
