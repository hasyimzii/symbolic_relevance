Strategies for developing vaccines against acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
There exists an abundance of literature on the prospects for developing vaccines  against the etiologic viral agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Excellent reviews from a variety of investigators are available on this subject. It is our intention to review the literature relative to potential strategies for developing a successful AIDS vaccine and to impart some of our concerns on the different types of vaccine that are being tested. We have also focused on some vaccine strategies that have not received much attention in previous review articles. Finally, the role of animal models in assessing vaccine safety and efficacy against AIDS has been briefly described.
