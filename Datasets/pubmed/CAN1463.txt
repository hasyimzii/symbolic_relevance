Stimulation of DNA synthesis in calcium deprived T51B liver cells by the tumor promoters phenobarbital, saccharin, and 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate.
Extracellular calcium deprivation arrested the proliferative development of T51B  rat liver cells in late G1 or S phases. These arrested cells initiated DNA synthesis within an hr after addition of calcium or a tumor promoter such as phorbol 12,13 didecanoate, phenobarbital, saccharin, or 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate. Nonpromoting relatives of 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate such as phorbol, 4 O methyl 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate, and 4 alpha phorbol 12,13 didecanoate were unable significantly to induce the calcium deprived cells to initiate DNA synthesis. It is suggested that an ability to elicit a prompt DNA synthetic response from calcium deprived cells might be a useful in vitro indicator of tumor promoting potential.
