Selective inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by the ( ) but not the (+) enantiomer of gossypol.
The ( ) enantiomer of gossypol but not the (+) enantiomer had good antiviral activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 at a concentration more than 20 fold lower than that required for cytotoxicity; however, in H9 cells the ( ) enantiomer, although more potent as an antiviral agent, was more cytotoxic.
