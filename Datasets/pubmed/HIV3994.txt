Global warfare against AIDS, report on the Sixth International Conference on AIDS, San Francisco, California, 20 25 June, 1990.
Reports of AIDS cases continue to increase in all countries. Heterosexual transfer is on the rise with subsequent implications for maternity care. Young men and women at the beginning of their sexual lives are at great risk for HIV exposure since unprotected sexual intercourse is rampant. Behaviour changes are necessary. Society is charged to indiscriminately care for all of its members. Legal protection for people with AIDS is necessary. Orphans, mothers and families need special assistance. The challenge has been made. History will determine our success.
