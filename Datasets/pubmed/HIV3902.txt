The value of cerebral biopsy in patients with AIDS and extensive cerebral lesions.
We performed cerebral biopsy in 4 patients with AIDS and evidence of expanding intracerebral lesions. Three patients had cerebral toxoplasmosis and the fourth had Chagas encephalitis. No patient developed complications. We feel that cerebral biopsy is warranted and safe in patients with AIDS and intracerebral lesions of uncertain origin.
