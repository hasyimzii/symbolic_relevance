Cis platinum (II) diaminedichloride: another cause of bilateral small kidneys.
Cis platinum (II) diaminedichloride (CPDD) is a new chemotherapeutic agent whose  major side effect is renal toxicity. Serial urography may show evidence of a diminution of renal size before there is any clinical evidence of renal failure in patients being treated with CPDD. We recommend that these patients be followed closely with serial radioisotope scanning and/or urography to detect early renal damage.
