Carcinoma of the ovary  correlation of ultrasound with second look laparotomy.
In a series of twenty six patients with Stage III or IV carcinoma of the ovary, results of ultrasound examination of the pelvis and abdomen were correlated with second look laparotomy. All of these patients had responded clinically to a course of chemotherapy. Elective surgery was used to restage and debulk tumour. Ultrasound examination was done before surgery. Ultrasound was sensitive in detecting ovarian tumour in the pelvis and had an 84 per cent correlation with laparotomy. It was also sensitive in detecting liver and right diaphragmatic metastases with a 92 per cent correlation with the laparotomy findings. However, it consistently failed to detect intraperitoneal spread except when disease was gross or when it could be predicted by the presence of ascites. The correlation with laparotomy in this situation was only 36 per cent. This is to be expected as the size of most peritoneal deposits is below the resolution of ultrasound. These lesions, however, are easily detected by laparoscopy. These findings suggest that ultrasound has an important role in the management of advanced carcinoma of the ovary.
