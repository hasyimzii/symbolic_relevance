Eye tracking dysfunction in Alzheimer type dementia.
Performance on visual tracking tasks was measured in groups of Alzheimer type dementia, pseudodementia of depression, and elderly normal controls. Smooth pursuit tracking errors were identified by counting the number of catch up saccades required to compensate for failure of the smooth pursuit system. The group with Alzheimer type dementia had significantly worse (p less than 0.0001) smooth pursuit tracking than either pseudodementia subjects or elderly normal controls. A strong correlation (r = 0.74, p less than 0.005) was found in Alzheimer patients between severity of visual tracking abnormality and severity of dementia.
