Purification of biologically active human immunodeficiency virus rev protein from Escherichia coli.
A genetic approach was used to facilitate purification of human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) rev protein. A recombinant protein containing a stretch of six histidine residues at the amino terminus was engineered and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Purification of greater than 95% was achieved in a single step using an immobilized metal ion chromatography with a resin that has selectivity for proteins with neighboring histidine residues. We show that the modified protein is both properly modified and biologically active.
