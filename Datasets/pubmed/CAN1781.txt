Extracellular idiotypic immunoglobulin arising from human leukemic B lymphocytes.
The peripheral blood lymphocytes of nine out of nine patients with typical surface Ig positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia but no paraprotein visible on serum electrophoresis have been shown by radioimmunoassay to export small amounts of pentameric IgM during culture (in the range of 2.4 7.2 ng/10(7) cells per h); three out of nine also exported monomeric IgD (0.7 1.4 ng/10(7) cells per h). Immunoglobulin turned over on the cell surface did not appear to contribute to material in the culture fluid, except possibly as vesicle bound Ig. In three cases, which included two of the IgD producers, anti idiotypic antibody raised against the cell surface Fab mu was used to demonstrate the idiotypic nature of the exported Ig. Anti idiotypic antibody was also used to measure levels of idiotypic Ig in the sera of these three patients as a proportion of the total Ig. Total serum IgM was depressed in all three patients, and the idiotypic IgM represented 43%, 65%, and 96% of the IgM. The findings suggest that in typical chronic lymphocytic leukemia involving B lymphocytes, the export of a small amount of idiotypic Ig by the neoplastic cells in a common or even usual occurrence.
