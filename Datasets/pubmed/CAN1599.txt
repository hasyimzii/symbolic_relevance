Solitary bone cysts with expansion throughout the complete humerus (author's transl).
The paper contains two case reports of solitary bone cysts of the humerus, which  expanded throughout the complete bone from the upper end to the lower. This unusual size was seen in a 12 year old boy after subtotal resection of an active cyst at the age of 6 years, with recurrence of the cyst. In the other case an 18 year old female patient felt pain in her left arm after sports. The X ray picture showed a cystic transformation of the complete humerus. The histodiagnosis of the disease was made by multiple, repeated biopsy. Other cystic bone lesions, which are important concerning differential diagnosis, were excluded by detailed examination. No further pathological findings were made in both cases.
