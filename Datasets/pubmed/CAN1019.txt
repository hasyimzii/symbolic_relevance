Cytostatic treatment of hypernephroid renal carcinoma (author's transl).
Thirty patients with metastasing hypernephroid renal carcinoma were treated with  sequential cytostatic combinations of vincristine and ifosfamide (Holoxan inverted question mark). Two complete and two partial remissions and arrest of tumour growth in two cases were achieved. These results justify use of at least time limited chemotherapy so as not to miss a chance of long term remission in tumour patients.
