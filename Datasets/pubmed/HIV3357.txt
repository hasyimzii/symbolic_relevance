Neurological features in AIDS patients: studies on cerebrospinal fluid.
The relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of HIV infection and the spectrum of neurological manifestations were studied in 15 AIDS patients (13 with and 2 without confirmed neurological disorders). We demonstrated the presence of intrathecally synthesized anti HIV antibodies. Antibodies to HIV envelope proteins were present in all patients but those to HIV core proteins in 9/13 cases only. HIV antigen and HIV p24 antigen were present in 6/14 and 4/12 cases respectively. HIV was not isolated from 6 samples of CSF. We have demonstrated that CSF markers of HIV infection were present in all AIDS patients, with or without neurological manifestations. Moreover HIV p24 antigen seems to be a very reliable marker of HIV infection.
