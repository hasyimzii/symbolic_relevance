Results of operation and irradiation in 683 cases with ovarian carcinoma (author's transl).
A report is given on 683 cases of ovarian cancer, who underwent postoperative radiation therapy at the Radiation Department of the 1st University Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Vienna. An uniform staging and histological classification is complicated by the fact, that in recent years the rate of cases operated elsewhere and subsequently admitted to our clinic went up to 76%. Of all 683 cases, 193 (28,3%) reached a five year survival time. Because of these still unsatisfying results of postoperative radiation treatment in ovarian cancer the importance and necessity of randomised studies with different therapeutic programs is emphasized.
