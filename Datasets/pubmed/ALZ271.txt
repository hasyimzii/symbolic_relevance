Spongiform like changes in Alzheimer's disease. An ultrastructural study.
THe ultrastructural study of the cortex of four patients with sporadic or familial AD, of two age matched controls without dementia, and of one normal pressure hydrocephalus, revealed in all the cases in the neuropil only occasional vacuoles which had a morphology similar to those observed in CJD. The degree of spongiform like changes was, however, far less prominent than in CJD and considered mild in all the cases examined. Moreover, curled fragments of membranes within the vacuoles were not observed. It is suggested that the mild vacuolization of the neuropil occasionally observed in cortical biopsies of AD is a non specific finding and cannot be considered a neuropathologic link between AD and CJD.
