Splenectomy in patients with AIDS.
To establish the indications for splenectomy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection we retrospectively analyzed 12 patients who underwent splenectomy. Patients with HIV infection who had immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) were excluded as they had no splenomegaly and a definite indication for splenectomy exists in some of these patients. All 12 patients were anemic; 6 were thrombocytopenic and 6 leukopenic. All patients had splenomegaly and all were febrile. At surgery 3 patients were found to have Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) infection; 2 had splenic abscess due to Salmonella group D; 1 each had cytomegalovirus (CMV) splenitis and localized Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) of the spleen. No definite histopathologic diagnosis could be made in five patients, all of whom had evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis. The degree of splenic enlargement did not correlate with the outcome. Both clinical and hematologic improvements were achieved in patients with splenic abscess and in patients who had splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The presence of either of these findings constitutes an indication for splenectomy. Anemia and/or leukopenia without thrombocytopenia failed to improve; the presence of MAI and active CMV infection also resulted in failure. The presence of either of these conditions may be considered a contraindication to splenectomy.
