The World Health Organization's global strategy for the prevention and control of AIDS.
The magnitude of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic and its broad impact have been seriously underestimated and underappreciated. The Special Programme on AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) of the World Health Organization (WHO) was created on February 1, 1987, as the architect and keystone of the global AIDS plan. The Special Programme on AIDS has designed the global strategy, has raised sufficient funds to begin implementing the strategy and, for this effort, has marshalled the support of every nation in the world. AIDS affects both the developing and the industrialized worlds; therefore, every country will need a national AIDS program. This is vital not only for national interests but also because ultimately AIDS cannot be stopped in any one country unless it is stopped in all countries. National AIDS programs are being rapidly established throughout the world with the technical and financial support of WHO's Special Programme on AIDS. At the global level, the Special Programme is responsible for strategic leadership, developing consensus, coordinating scientific research, exchanging information, assuring technical cooperation and mobilizing and coordinating resources. National AIDS committees have already been established in more than 150 countries and, by the end of 1988, the Special Programme will support every country in the world that requests collaboration.
