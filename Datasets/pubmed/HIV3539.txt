Role of pharmacists in reducing occupational exposure to HIV.
The role of pharmacists in reducing the occupational hazard of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission via needle stick injuries is described. Some 40% of all pharmaceuticals used in hospitals are now administered by injection, and sales of large volume injectable drug products continue to grow. Most needle stick injuries in which health care workers are exposed to HIV contaminated blood occur during recapping of used needles, picking up and carrying the needle, or placing it in a receptacle. Pharmacists are responsible not only for the purchase, storage, dispensing, and use of drug products but also for providing information about their administration and safe disposal. Single use vials, ampuls, and prefilled syringes must all be evaluated for availability, ease of use, and disposal. A major factor in drug purchasing decisions must be the safety of nurses. Syringes that have been redesigned to eliminate the need for recapping offer a major safety advantage. Needle disposal units should be made more conveniently accessible. Pharmacists can help prevent the transmission of HIV to health care workers by using their influence as educators and decision makers to reduce the risk of needle stick injury.
