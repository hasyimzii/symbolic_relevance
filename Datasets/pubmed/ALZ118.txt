A neuropathologic approach to human disease: the intracranial mass effect.
This review describes insults to the brain which result in either an increased or decreased mass effect. These mechanisms produce certain derangements in the central nervous system, which can lead to the patient's death. Increased intracranial mass effect characterized by brain tumors may produce lethal brain stem ischemia. On the other hand, decreased intracranial mass effect as seen in Alzheimer's disease leads to aspiration pneumonia and terminal sepsis.
