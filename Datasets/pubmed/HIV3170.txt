AIDS: medicolegal considerations for Canadian hospitals.
Given the increasing endemicity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the agent  implicated in the causation of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), in numerous sizeable subgroups of society, hospitals can expect increasing exposure to the legal implications presented by patients with AIDS. This paper reviews the duty of care owed by hospitals, both directly, through contractual obligations, and indirectly, through the acts of their employees and private contractors, to patients with AIDS, other patients and the public. Owing to the absence of case law directly related to AIDS or to HIV antibody reactivity, inferences were drawn from precedents set with other infectious diseases. Recommendations are made in the areas of confidentiality, informed consent, standards of care and vicarious liability.
