Open heart surgery with concomitant pulmonary resection.
With the increasing applicability of cardiac surgical procedures, particularly in older age groups, increasing numbers of patients will be encountered with concomitant diseases amenable to surgical treatment.(1) We present three patients who underwent pulmonary resection associated with various cardiac surgical procedures. One patient had severe bron chiectasis and mitral stenosis requiring mitral valve replacement with pneumonectomy. The other two patients had coronary artery disease and pulmonary neoplasms requiring pneumonectomy and bilobectomy concomitant with coronary bypass procedures. All patients survived and returned to constructive life. Operative techniques and therapeutic rationales are discussed.
