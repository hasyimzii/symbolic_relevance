Phorbol ester tumor promoters block the transition from the early to the heme dependent late program of Friend cell differentiation.
In this study, the mechanism of inhibition of differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells by the phorbol ester tumor promoter, 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate (TPA), has been examined. These studies indicate that some early events associated with Friend cell differentiation, including an early change in 86Rb+ transport and a decrease in cell volume, still occur in the presence of TPA. However, several late events in the program of Friend cell differentiation, including the induction of heme synthesis and the loss of proliferative capacity, are inhibited by TPA. These effects of TPA can be reversed by hemin, which alone does not induce Friend cells to differentiate. The addition of hemin to cultures grown in the presence of inducer plus TPA for several days results in the rapid restoration of hemoglobin synthesis, and also causes a parallel decrease in colony forming ability. These results suggest that tumor promoters may inhibit only heme dependent events, rather than the entire program of Friend cell differentiation.
