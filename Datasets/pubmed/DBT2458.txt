C Peptide reserve in insulin dependent diabetes. Comparative responses to glucose, glucagon and tolbutamide.
Residual beta cell secretory capacity was assessed in short term (2 months to 2 years) and long term (5 to 8 years) insulin dependent diabetics by measurement of serum C peptide immunoreactivity during three provocative tests: glucose, tolbutamide, and glucagon. Minimal C peptide secretion could be detected in only one out of seven long term diabetics by the stimulatory tests. All seven short term diabetics responded to at least one provocative test of beta cell reserve, although these responses were blunted. The greatest C peptide responses occurred after glucagon administration (mean increase 0.62 pmol/ml) in short term responders. Patients who responded to one test did not necessarily respond to another stimulus. There was no correlation between basal C peptide levels and the ability to provoke further C peptide secretion by any of the three tests. C peptide responses did not correlate with % Haemoglobin A1c, mean fasting blood glucose levels, or mean blood glucose concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test. The data indicate that stimulation tests are only useful in assessing endogenous beta cell reserve in patients with diabetes of less than 5 years duration. In diabetics of longer duration there is little insulin reserve above basal levels.
