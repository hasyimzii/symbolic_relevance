Leiomyosarcoma of the renal capsule: ultrasonographic and angiographic appearances: a case report (author's transl).
A 70 year old patient presented with general ill health, and a mass in the right  hypochondrium which was found to be a leiomyosarcoma of the renal capsule. Ultrasonography demonstrated the retroperitoneal origin of the tumor and its lack of relation with the right kidney. Arteriography showed the right renal capsule origin of the mass, with partial invasion of the inferior vena cava. Operation confirmed the angiographic findings, particularly the independent nature of the mass i relation to the kidney and the excretory pathways.
