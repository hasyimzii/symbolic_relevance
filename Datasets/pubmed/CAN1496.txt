Synchronous bilateral renal cell carcinoma: total surgical excision.
Sixty one patients with bilateral synchronous renal cell carcinoma have undergone total excision of their neoplastic disease. True follow up of the patients has been obtained from the surgeons or the patients themselves. Fifty one patients underwent renal parenchymal sparing procedures in one  or two stage operations. Successful extracorporeal tumor resection was performed on 17 kidneys. The local tumor recurrence rate is 10%. Ten patients underwent bilateral nephrectomy with maintenance hemodialysis, and 4 of these underwent renal transplantation. The 69% survival rate of the group at five years is better than that of unilateral renal cell carcinoma.
