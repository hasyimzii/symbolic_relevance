Prevalence and epidemiologic features of subjects found to be infected with HIV  when donating blood. CTS of the "Retrovirus" Study Group of the Societe Nationale de Transfusion Sanguine.
HIV seroprevalence decreased from 0.62% in 1985 to 0.11% in the first 1990 semester. However, the number of regular blood donors screened as seropositive remains constant since 1988: 48 in 1988, 49 in 1989 and 25 in the first 6 months of 1990. From these data, from reports on recipients and due to the exclusion of 30% of such donors by anti HBc screening, the residual risk to transmit HIV by blood transfusion was estimated to 17 blood donations per year in France. No significant change was observed throughout these years either in sex ratio or in the repartition into age groups. The number of HIV infected subjects through the heterosexual route has not increased. The number of homosexuals and of IVDA has dramatically decreased since 1985, homosexuals still representing the major at risk group.
