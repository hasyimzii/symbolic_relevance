Evaluation of a hospital admission HIV antibody voluntary screening program.
Voluntary screening for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is recommended by the healthcare profession. The optimal settings to accomplish screening have not been established. We evaluated an admission HIV screening program in a large private hospital to assess advantages and disadvantages in this setting. In a three month study period, 4,535 of 8,868 patients (51%) admitted to the hospital agreed to HIV testing. Serum specimens from 500 patients who refused testing were blindly, anonymously tested. The seroprevalence of the patients agreeing to (0.26%) and refusing (0.60%) testing was not statistically different (p = .12). There were 12 HIV cases discovered; ten (83%) of these were known to be in a high risk group at the time of admission. Eighty five percent of patients interviewed were in favor of this screening program. Difficulties associated with confidentiality or consent were not evident. Calculated charges of testing for each HIV case discovery was $14,550. There was no evidence that this screening program provided for a more effective infection control policy to prevent nosocomial HIV transmission. A hospital admission HIV screening program can be implemented, can meet with favorable patient opinion and can detect previously unknown HIV positive patients. Hospitals are an efficient and practical setting for HIV testing. The benefit of this program appears to be greater for the patient than hospital or healthcare worker. Cost benefit analyses will identify optimal candidates to be screened in different hospital populations.
