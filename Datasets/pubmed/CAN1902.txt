Post traumatic alpha and mu wave foci (author's transl).
28 patients with an activated focus (8 12 c/s focus) in the central region were examined for mu wave activity utilizing visual and calculation of the coherence function. Over 60% (18 patients) of these foci were mu wave foci. This type of mu waves was decidedly less sensitive to change in vigilance than physiological mu waves. Seven foci were alpha foci and three foci could be classified as neither alpha  nor mu wave foci since they did not react to sensory and sensomotoric stimuli. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the pathological mu waves and the pathological alpha waves were very similar in their characteristics.
