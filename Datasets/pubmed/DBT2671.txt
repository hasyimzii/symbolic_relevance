Pancreatic B cell response to a test meal in lean and obese diabetic patients: relation to metabolic control.
We have measured fasting C peptide reactivity (CPR) as well as CPR responses to a test meal in 83 diabetic patients and 41 non diabetic controls. In comparison to controls, basal CPR was decreased in lean insulin treated diabetics with stable or brittle diabetes and in obese patients with brittle diabetes. Lean and obese maturity onset diabetics had increased CPR levels and so had obese insulin treated patients. Nevertheless, the CPR response to the test meal was clearly inadequate in all diabetics. In control patients, there was a positive correlation between fasting blood glucose and CPR levels. On the contrary, lean diabetics demonstrated a negative correlation between these parameters. Hemoglobin A1 levels were negatively correlated to fasting CPR levels in lean diabetics, indicating the importance of residual B cell function for diabetes control. These correlations were obscured in obese diabetics. In our patients, circulating insulin antibodies had apparently no deleterious effect on metabolic control.
