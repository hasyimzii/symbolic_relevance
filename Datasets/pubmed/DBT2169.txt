Modification of haloalkane induced hepatotoxicity by exogenous ketones and metabolic ketosis.
A variety of chemicals potentiate haloalkane induced liver injury, but structure activity relationships are not apparent. Recent studies have shown that one structural determinant, a carbonyl moiety, is common to several potentiating agents. Thus five ketonic chemicals (acetone, 2 butanone, methyl n butylketone, 2,5 hexanedione, Kepone) and three chemicals that are metabolized to ketones (isopropranol, 2 butanol, n hexane) potentiate the liver injury produced by one or more haloalkanes. Potentiation also has been observed when haloalkanes are administered to animals in a state of metabolic ketosis produced by alloxan induced diabetes or by 1,3 butanediol administration. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that administration or generation of ketonic substances increases the susceptibility of the liver to the toxic actions of haloalkanes.
