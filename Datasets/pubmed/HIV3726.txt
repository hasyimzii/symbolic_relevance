Twenty sera and 16 CSF submitted by AIDS patients showed positive antibody reactions in both ELISA and Western blot assay, whereas, antibody was not detected in the sera and the CSF obtained from high risk group or laboratory personnel. An overall of 21% (10/48) positive rate was found in the specimens submitted by AIDS patients for HIV antigen detection by ELISA. The positive rates of HIV antigen in sera, CSF and stool specimen from the AIDS patients were 30% (6/20), 13% (2/16) and 17% (2/12), respectively.
