Liver cell tumours in rats fed hexachlorobenzene.
All animals in a group of female Agus rats fed 100 ppm of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in their diet for up to 90 weeks developed multiple liver cell tumours whereas none were seen in control rats. There was no evidence of skin lesions or nervous symptoms usually seen with higher doses of HCB. A high incidence of liver cell tumours was also seen with MRC Wistar female rats fed HCB for 75 weeks.
