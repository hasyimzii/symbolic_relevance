Maintaining health in persons with HIV infection.
Despite the inroads that have been made in the treatment and diagnosis of HIV infection, many health care providers have an attitude of hopelessness and pity. Those of us who believe ourselves to be healthy have goals, aspirations, plans, and projects that guide our living. These are our reasons for living: they provide hope, meaning, and substance to our lives. Each of us conducts our life according to individualized personal choices and priorities as do individuals with HIV infection. The patient's autonomy provides a freedom of choice that extends to benign and harmful methods of maintaining health and preventing illness. The individual chooses what will be of most help. The nurse assesses the patient's activities toward health from the patient's perspective. When these activities involve alternative methods, the nurse needs to assess whether or not these are harmful. Providing a nonjudgmental environment for assessment and care will facilitate the patient's providing information about all activities being used to promote or maintain health or prevent illness. Studies have begun to establish that responses to specific stress situations can result in impaired immunity, so the nurse's effort in helping individuals maintain the highest level of health possible has become even more important. The nurse provides a critical link between the individual and the health care complex for optimum communication, comfort, and care in the pursuit of health.
