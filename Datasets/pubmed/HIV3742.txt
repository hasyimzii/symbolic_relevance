Low prevalence of neuro psychiatric clinical manifestations in central African patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
In order to evaluate the frequency of neurological and psychiatric disorders in central African patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 93 inpatients at the National Hospital Centre of Bangui were selected according to the World Health Organization (Bangui) clinical definition of AIDS and were confirmed to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 (92/93) or HIV 2 (1/93) by Western blot. Neurological (11/15) and psychiatric (4/15) abnormalities were clinically detected in 16% (15/93) of African patients with AIDS. In this series, the prevalence of neuro psychiatric disorders appeared to be lower than in Europe and North America.
