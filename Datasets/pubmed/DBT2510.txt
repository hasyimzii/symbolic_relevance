A possible mechanism for the anti ketogenic action of alanine in the rat.
1. The anti ketogenic effect of alanine has been studied in normal starved and diabetic rats by infusing l alanine for 90min in the presence of somatostatin (10mug/kg body wt. per h) to suppress endogenous insulin and glucagon secretion. 2. Infusion of alanine at 3mmol/kg body wt. per h caused a 70+/ 11% decrease in [3 hydroxybutyrate] and a 58+/ 9% decrease in [acetoacetate] in 48h starved rats. [Glucose] and [lactate] increased, but [non esterified fatty acid], [glycerol] and [3 hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] were unchanged. 3. Infusion of alanine at 1mmol/kg body wt. per h caused similar decreases in [ketone body] (3 hydroxybutyrate plus acetoacetate) in 24h starved normal and diabetic rats, but no change in other blood metabolites. 4. Alanine [3mmol/kg body wt. per h] caused a 72+/ 9% decrease in the rate of production of ketone bodies and a 57+/ 8% decrease in disappearance rate as assessed by [3 (14)C]acetoacetate infusion. Metabolic clearance was unchanged, indicating that the primary effect of alanine was inhibition of hepatic ketogenesis. 5. Aspartate infusion at 6mmol/kg body wt. per h had similar effects on blood ketone body concentrations in 48h starved rats. 6. Alanine (3mmol/kg body wt. per h) caused marked increases in hepatic glutamate, aspartate, malate, lactate and citrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 phosphoglycerate and glucose concentrations and highly significant decreases in [3 hydroxybutyrate] and [acetoacetate]. Calculated [oxaloacetate] was increased 75%. 7. Similar changes in hepatic [malate], [aspartate] and [ketone bodies] were found after infusion of 6mmol of aspartate/kg body wt. per h. 8. It is suggested that the anti ketogenic effect of alanine is secondary to an increase in hepatic oxaloacetate and hence citrate formation with decreased availability of acetyl CoA for ketogenesis. The reciprocal negative feedback cycle of alanine and ketone bodies forms an important non hormonal regulatory system.
