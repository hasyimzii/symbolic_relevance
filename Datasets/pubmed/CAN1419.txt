Complications of ureteroileal conduit with radical cystectomy: review of 336 cases.
Review of complications of the ileal conduit in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer showed a statistically significant increase in renal calculi, ureteral obstruction, acute and chronic pyelonephritis and deterioration of renal function by 60 months postoperatively. Ureteroileal fistulas occurred in 3.3 per cent, stomal stenosis in 5.1 per cent, intestinal fistulas in 5.4 per cent, severe intestinal obstruction in 6 per cent and abdominal wound infection or dehiscence in 20.2 per cent of the cases. The over all operative mortality was 13.7 per cent, with 8 per cent of the deaths attributed to complications from the ileal conduit. Comparison of colonic conduits to ileal conduits as a means of urinary diversion with radical cystectomy for bladder cancer demonstrated no convincing evidence of its superiority.
