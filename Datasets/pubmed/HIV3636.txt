Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNase H by sulfated polyanions.
The reverse transcriptase (RT) activity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and other retroviruses is closely associated with a hybrid degrading RNase H activity which is essential for retroviral replication. We have analyzed the effect of sulfated polysaccharides on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 recombinant RT and RNase H activities in vitro. Heparin, dextran sulfates, and xylan polysulfate were found to be much more potent inhibitors of RNase H than of RT and exhibit 50% infective doses of 0.04 to 0.1 micrograms/ml (corresponding to 0.1 to 25 nM) which is up to 5,000 fold more efficient than that for RT. Inhibitors of RNase H activity are attractive as antiviral drugs.
