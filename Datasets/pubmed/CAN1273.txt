The response of murine lymphoma cells   L5178Y S & R   at heat at 44 degrees C.
Two murine lymphoma cell lines L5178YS and L5178YR were exposed to heat at 44 degrees C. In comparison with other cell lines there were found to be among the most sensitive to the lethal action of heat studied to date. The difference between these cell lines in response to heat was very small when compared to the differences observed with ionizing radiation. The pattern of leakage of radiolabelled leucine at 44 degrees C was measured in each cell line and small changes compared with the behavior at 37 degrees C were observed. No net breakdown or loss of preformed protein was observed during heating nor did any labelled protein leak from the cells.
