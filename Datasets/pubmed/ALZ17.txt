Demonstration of CSF gamma globulin banding in presenile dementia.
An improved agarose gel electrophoretic technique was used to fractionate serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins in patients with presenile dementia. The CSF electrophoretic patterns demonstrated three abnormal bands in the gamma globulin region in five out of eight of these patients.
