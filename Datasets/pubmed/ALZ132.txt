Histocompatibility antigens (HLA) and patterns of cognitive loss in dementia of the Alzheimer type.
Recent data suggest that a proportion of patients with primary neuronal degeneration of the Alzheimer type have the HLA B7 antigen. However, the possibility that other differences might exist between patients with and without the marker has not been examined. We tested a range of cognitive skills in Alzheimer patients with and without the HLA B7 to examine whether those individuals with the HLA marker would exhibit a profile of cognitive loss different from those without it. Our results indicate that patients with HLA B7 antigens had selective attentional scores that were significantly lower than Alzheimer patients without the antigen. Neither group was significantly different in either memory capacity or retrieval from short term and long term memory. The data support the hypothesis that there may be more than one disorder in what is now referred to as dementia of the Alzheimer type.
