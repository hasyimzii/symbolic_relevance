Pancreatic B cell peptides: kinetic behaviour and concentrations of proinsulin,  insulin and C peptide in plasma and urine, problems of assay methods, clinical significance and literature review (author's transl).
The kinetics and the concentrations of B cell peptides in plasma and urine are reviewed. Methodical problems in the determination of proinsulin, free and antibody bound insulin and C peptide are discussed, together with the possible application of these methods in the control of insulin dependent diabetics.
