Congenital anomalies in children with testicular germ cell tumor.
The incidence and type of congenital anomalies associated with childhood testicular germ cell tumors were studied retrospectively in 25 patients (20 cases of yolk sac tumor and 5 cases of teratoma). Congenital anomalies were observed in 3 patients with yolk sac tumors and in 1 patient who had a mature teratoma. The abnormalities observed included individual cases of retrocaval ureter, diverticulum of the bladder, Down's syndrome and an ipsilateral inguinal hernia. Children with a testicular tumor should be examined closely for congenital abnormalities.
