Cellular requirements for production and release of the lymphocyte costimulator.
The lymphocyte costimulator (CoS) is a lymphokine required for the activation of  T cell responses to H 2 alloantigens or mitogen, CoS activity is found in the supernatant medium of Concanavalin A (Con A) stimulated spleen cells, In this paper we investigate the cellular requirements for CoS production by Con A activated mouse spleen cells. Maximal lymphokine production in response to Con A depends on a co operative interaction between T cells and a nylon wool adherent cell present in the spleen of nude mice. T cells appear to be the major producers of CoS activity, doing so only in response to an initial inductive stimulus supplied by nude spleen cells. The inductive stimulus is found as a soluble factor in the supernatant of Con A activated spleen cells, and can also be provided by stimulatory (S+), but not by non stimulatory (S ), tumour cells H 2 identical with the responding T cells. The activation of lymphokine producing T cells is thus a two signal process, requiring both mitogen and an additional inductive signal. Once activated, homogeneous populations of T cells will release lymphokine in response to mitogen alone.
