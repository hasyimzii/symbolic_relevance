Behavior of gastrinemia, insulinemia and glucagonemia in normal and diabetic subjects after a protein meal accompanied by cimetidine.
Blood gastrin, sugar, insulin and glucagon were studied after a protein meal with or without 400 mg cymethidine per os in 7 normal subjects and 14 with anacidotic adult diabetes in a reasonable state of glycometabolic compensation. The association led to a significant enhancement of gastrin after 120' and 180', plus a rise in the total integrated gastrin response. Sugar and insulin were unaffected, while glucagon was distinclty, though not signifacantly, reduced. In a discussion of the results it is suggested that the rise in gastrin after cymethidine is not solely due to a pH dependent negative feedback, since this should have led to an earlier (30', 60') rise, but also to the slight suppression of glucagon, which is physiologically endowed with the ability to inhibit secretion.
