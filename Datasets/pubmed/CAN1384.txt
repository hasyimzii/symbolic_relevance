Embolization for genitourinary disorders.
Fourteen patients with various genitourinary disorders underwent arterial embolization. The procedure was useful in facilitating surgical removal of hypernephromas, in decreasing tumor induced hypercalcemia, and in diminishing proteinuria secondary to renal failure. Patients with priapism due to excessive arterial inflow responded well. Results of embolization performed because of bleeding varied. When bleeding was localized to a single vessel or to an area supplied by such a vessel, embolization was successful. However, when hemorrhage was diffuse or due to multiple vessel inflow, arterial embolization was not entirely effective.
