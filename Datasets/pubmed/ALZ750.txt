High density lipoprotein cholesterol in differential diagnosis of senile dementia.
Levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol were found to be significantly lower in 5 men with multi infarct dementia than in 12 men with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. The large difference between the groups suggests that levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol may be useful in differential diagnosis of these two kinds of senile dementia. The finding also supports the theory that multi infarct dementia may be a complication of atherosclerosis.
