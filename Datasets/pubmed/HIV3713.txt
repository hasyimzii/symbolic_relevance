Biological characterization of paired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid.
Virus has been isolated from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of eight subjects with varying severity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) infection and from the frontal lobe of one patient with AIDS. The five patients with AIDS related complex (ARC) and AIDS also showed neurological/psychiatric complications. With the exception of one isolate from the CSF of an asymptomatic carrier, all isolates replicated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes after cell free transmission. Isolates obtained from the blood of patients in late stages of HIV infection replicated in 3 (of 4) cases in H9 cells, whereas none of the blood isolates from patients in the early stages did so. The capacity of CSF isolates to replicate in H9 cells was low (only 2 of 12). Paired virus isolates from blood and CSF of the same patient could be distinguished by their replicative capacity in different cell lines, type of cytopathic effect, and protein profile as tested by radioimmunoprecipitation. The results indicate that variant viruses with distinct biological characteristics may be isolated from the blood and CSF of the same patient.
