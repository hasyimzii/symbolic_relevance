Intrafamilial clustering of anti ATLA positive persons.
A total of 1,333 persons in 627 families were surveyed for presence of antibody to adult T cell leukemia associated antigen (anti ATLA). Each person was classified according to the anti ATLA status (positive for sample 1, negative for sample 2) of the head of household of his or her family. In sample 1, the sex  and age standardized prevalence of anti ATLA was 38.5%. This was five times as high as the standardized prevalence in sample 2 (7.8%). There were significant differences in prevalence of anti ATLA between males in samples 1 and 2 and between females in samples 1 and 2. In every age group, prevalence in sample 1 was greater than that in sample 2 except for males aged 60 69 years. In each of four subareas, families in sample 1 had higher standardized prevalence (29.6 42.5%) than families in sample 2 (6.0 9.7%). Although crude prevalence decreased with family size in sample 1 (62.1 25.4%) as well as in sample 2, indirectly standardized prevalence was almost equal within each sample, regardless of number of family members. The degree of aggregation was independent of locality and family size. These data suggest that anti ATLA positive persons aggregate in family units.
