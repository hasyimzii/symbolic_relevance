Distribution of fibronectin in normal and diseased human kidneys.
The distribution of fibronectin in 42 renal biopsies was investigated using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique on paraffin sections of formalin fixed material. Biopsies were obtained from normal human kidneys and from patients with a variety of glomerular disorders. In normal glomeruli, fibronectin was present in Bowman's capsule, in the mesangium, and outlining peripheral capillary loops. A significant increase in fibronectin was observed in most types of glomerulopathy with a distribution closely related to the histopathological diagnosis. Fibronectin was diminished or absent in segmental scars, old diabetic nodules, and hyalinised glomeruli.
