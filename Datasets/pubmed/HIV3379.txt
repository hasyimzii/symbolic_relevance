Effects of passive immunization in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome related complex and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) is usually followed by a vigorous immune response that temporarily protects against disease progression. After a variable asymptomatic period, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related complex (ARC) and AIDS develop in most infected individuals. We have demonstrated that healthy HIV 1 infected individuals have neutralizing antibodies and a high titer of antiviral antibodies. In contrast, AIDS patients have undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies, low titers of antiviral antibodies, and, frequently, HIV p24 antigenemia. These observations prompted us to attempt passive immunization in ARC and AIDS patients. Ten consistently viral antigen positive patients (mean, greater than 6 months) were treated, resulting in sustained clearance of p24 antigen. Patients either maintained or increased their antiviral antibody titers. The raised titers result from increased antibody synthesis by the recipients. Circulating CD4+ cell counts were unchanged after 2 months. By the third month none of these patients remained in hospital. As this treatment was of minimal toxicity, it merits wider evaluation in ARC and AIDS patients.
