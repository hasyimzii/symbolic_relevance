Postirradiation osteosarcoma of pelvic bone with unusual histological pattern.
This paper reports an osteosarcoma of the pelvic bone appearing 8 years after postoperative radiation therapy for carcinoma of the uterus and ovary. Unusual was the existence of well differentiated parts and possibly early sarcomatous changes which were found only in the primary tumour and not in the metastases.
