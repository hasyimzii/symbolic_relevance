Paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma in an adult.
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is a common tumor of children, rarely appearing in the scrotum from tunica vaginalis or paratesticular tissues. In adults it is rare and carries a particularly bad prognosis. A case of paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma occurring in a seventy three year old man who survived a total of five and one half years from the time of his original operation, is presented.
