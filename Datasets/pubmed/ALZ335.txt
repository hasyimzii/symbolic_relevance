Classification of dementia patients by a WAIS profile related to central cholinergic deficiencies.
Sixty two patients were classified as having Alzheimer type dementia (AD) or multi infarct dementia (MID) on the basis of clinical criteria. Protocols from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) were scored according to a formula reported by Fuld to reflect the effects of scopolamine administration in young adults. The formula correctly classified 13 of 23 AD patients and 37 of 39 MID patients. The formula was similar to Wechsler's deterioration quotient, which produced a greater number of false positives. The formula did not appear to be biased by age, sex, or severity of impairments. Results suggest that the neuropsychological investigation of AD which emphasizes the deficiencies in cholinergic neurotransmission may be a fruitful avenue of further investigation.
