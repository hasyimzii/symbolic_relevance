Somatostatin like immunoreactivity in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid from neurohistologically examined demented patients.
The concentration of somatostatin like immunoreactivity (SLI) in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid was measured in clinically suspected examples of either Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Pick's disease and controls. No significant correlation was found between the concentration of SLI and the age (22 73 years) of controls. Histological examination of brain material from the demented patients enabled the samples to be divided into AD and examples of clinically suspected AD or Pick's disease without specific histological change. The mean concentration of SLI was only slightly reduced in patients with AD in the presenium compared to control, and was unaltered from control in the examples of AD of senile age. The group of demented patients without specific histological change had a reduced concentration of SLI in lumbar CSF compared to control patients.
