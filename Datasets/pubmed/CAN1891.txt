Angiomyoma of the palate.
Oral tumors of smooth muscle origin are rare. Most oral leiomyomas are believed to be derived from vascular smooth muscle. The leiomyomas are divided into angiomyomas and leiomyomas depending on the degree of vascularity. Differentiation must be made from neurofibromas and other spindle cell tumors, as well as leiomyosarcomas.
