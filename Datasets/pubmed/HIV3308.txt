HIV expression strategies: ribosomal frameshifting is directed by a short sequence in both mammalian and yeast systems.
The pol gene of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1) is expressed as a gag:pol fusion, arising from a ribosomal frameshift that brings the overlapping, out of phase gag and pol genes into translational phase. In this study, we show that HIV frameshifting is mediated by a very short sequence in the viral RNA. We demonstrate the importance of a homopolymeric run within this sequence and conclude that HIV frameshifting is not dependent on stem loop structures downstream from the frameshift site. Our analysis also indicates that the sequence requirements are identical in mammalian and yeast systems.
