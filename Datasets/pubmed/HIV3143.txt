Octapeptides deduced from the neuropeptide receptor like pattern of antigen T4 in brain potently inhibit human immunodeficiency virus receptor binding and T cell infectivity.
The differentiation antigen T4, present on the helper/inducer subset of T lymphocytes, is thought to serve as the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We find that a 60 kDa protein, immunoprecipitable by monoclonal antibody (mAb) OKT4, is present on membranes from human brain as well as human T cells. Furthermore, the radioiodinated HIV envelope glycoprotein [125I labeled gp120 (125I gp120)] can be specifically covalently affixed to a molecule present on rat, monkey, and human brain membranes to yield a complex that is indistinguishable from that formed on human T cells. T4 antigen has been studied on unfixed squirrel monkey, rat, and human brain sections by autoradiography using the mAb OKT4. A highly conserved neuroanatomical pattern has been demonstrated, suggesting an analogous organization in these three mammalian brains. Furthermore, the localization of 125I gp120 receptor binding appears similar to that of T4 and is highly reminiscent of patterns for many previously characterized neuropeptide receptors. A computer assisted analysis of gp120 suggested that a previously unremarkable octapeptide sequence within the gp120 protein, which we have synthesized and termed "peptide T," may play an important role in HIV attachment. Thus, peptide T and three rationally designed peptide analogs, each with a systematic amino acid substitution, potently inhibit specific 125I gp120 binding to brain membranes. Additionally, when tested in a viral infectivity assay, these peptides show the same rank order and similar absolute potency to block HIV infection of human T cells. Thus, peptide T may provide a useful pharmacological or immunological basis for the control and treatment of AIDS.
