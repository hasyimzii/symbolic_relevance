What's new in human herpesvirus 6? Clinical immunopathology of the HHV 6 infection.
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV 6), formerly known as human B lymphotropic virus (HBLV), was first isolated in 1986 from patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and AIDS. Antibody prevalence against HHV 6 varies between about 60 80% indicating a widespread latent infection. Although HHV 6 infects in vivo primarily T lymphocytes, it is associated with similar diseases as in infection with Epstein Barr virus (EBV), a clearly B lymphotropic virus. Reactivation of latent HHV 6 infection in patients with subnormal host defense may cause persistent active infection with so called postinfectious chronic fatigue syndrome (PICFS) or may contribute to other pathologies such as immune deficiency itself, autoimmune disorders or progressive lymphoproliferation. Coinfection of CD4 cells by HHV 6 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1) in AIDS patients can aggravate HIV induced acquired immune deficiency. These characteristics of the only recently detected new virus justify further intense investigation.
