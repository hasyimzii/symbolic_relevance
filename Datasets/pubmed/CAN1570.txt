Epitheliomas of the margin of the larynx. Definition, classification and extension (author's transl).
Studying 213 cases of epithelioma of the laryngeal margin, the authors report on  a 3 part study. The first part defines, classifies and specifies the extension of marginal epitheliomas, the second part studies anterior margin epitheliomas and the third, epitheliomas of the lateral margin. This first part shows that the laryngeal margin forms a precise anatomo clinical entity which must be subdivided into anterior lateral posterior and total margins. The anterior margin consists of the free edge, the supra hyoid laryngeal side of the epiglottis and, for the authors, the laryngeal side of the epiglottis that belongs, for the UICC, to the oropharynx. The lateral margin consists of the aryteno epiglottic fold and, for the authors, of the intersection of the three fold that are not mentioned in the UICC or the AJC classifications. The arytenoid cartilage forms the posterior margin. Together, tumors of the anterior margin and the lateral margin make up for 94% of marginal tumors. This first part specifies the macroscopic aspects of marginal epitheliomas with their local and lymphatic extension.
