Subunit vaccines against exogenous retroviruses: overview and perspectives.
Vaccines prepared from purified viral envelope complexes are effective against certain animal model tumors induced by exogenous retroviruses. Related viruses have recently been isolated from humans and obviously cause adult T cell leukemia and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Knowledge accumulated in experiments with subunit vaccines against animal retroviruses could help to develop immunopreventive regimens against human retroviruses.
