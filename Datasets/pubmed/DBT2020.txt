Evidence that vasopressin is involved in the isoprenaline induced beta endorphin  release.
We investigated in conscious rats, whether vasopressin, whose release was stimulated by isoprenaline (i.m.), caused the simultaneous increase in plasma beta endorphin like immunoreactivity (beta EI). The increase in plasma beta EI following isoprenaline administration was diminished by about 50% in rats pretreated with a vasopressin antagonist and also in rats with a hereditary absolute lack of vasopressin. We conclude that the isoprenaline induced release of beta EI is mediated in part by vasopressin.
