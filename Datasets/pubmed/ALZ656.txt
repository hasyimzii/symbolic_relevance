Response competition in recognition memory in three amnesic groups.
Experimental studies have suggested that a feature of the memory defect in some amnesic conditions may be a failure to inhibit competing responses at retrieval. It is not known whether this feature is present equally in different syndromes involving amnesia. Employing a recognition memory paradigm with varying numbers of response alternatives (based on Miller, 1978), three amnesic groups (Korsakov's, senile dementia, and multi infarct dementia) were compared using four types of test material. The groups were not differentially affected by increasing numbers of response alternatives.
