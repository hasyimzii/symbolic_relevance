Telangiectases corrected of the anterior chest in homosexual men.
Physical examination by a single clinician showed that 17 of 51 asymptomatic homosexual men and 19 of 26 men with persistent lymphadenopathy had linear telangiectasias in a broad, crescent distribution across the chest. The telangiectasias were commonly associated with erythema in the same distribution. Of the 36 men with telangiectasias, 25 were positive for serum antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), whereas only 15 of 41 men without telangiectasias were seropositive (p = 0.001). Biopsy studies of supraclavicular skin from 6 of the men with HIV antibody and telangiectasias showed a characteristic pattern of dilated blood vessels with a perivascular small cell infiltrate; no endothelial proliferation was noted. This histopathologic pattern was not consistently observed in HIV seronegative men regardless of whether they had telangiectasias. These data show that telangiectasias of the upper chest are a relatively common finding in homosexual men and that they are significantly, although not exclusively, associated with HIV infection.
