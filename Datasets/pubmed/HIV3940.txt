Inhibition of receptor mediated cellular entry of viruses including HIV: a perspective on further researches on chemotherapy in viral diseases including AIDS.
Receptor mediated endocytosis is a well recognized process by which many cells internalize and intracellularly process important biological molecules including viruses. The present hypothesis, addressing receptor mediated cellular entry of viruses including HIV, describes a perspective of further basic studies seen through the current knowledge about pharmacological control of various steps of receptor mediated endocytosis of different ligands and viruses as well. It proposes a list of more than 20 chemicals, targeted at inhibition of viral internalization and viral release into the cytoplasm, via their action(s) on transglutaminase, calmodulin, protein kinase C, and intraendosomal pH. It is cautiously suggested that a proper study of these chemicals may reveal some therapeutic values of their own in some viral diseases including AIDS.
