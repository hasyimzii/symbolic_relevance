Abnormal pancreatic polypeptide response to oral glucose loading diabetes mellitus.
In order to elucidate the abnormality of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) secretion in diabetes mellitus, basal plasma PP levels and their response to oral glucose loading were measured in normal subjects and diabetic patients. Fasting plasma PP levels were significantly elevated in patients with diabetes mellitus. Oral administration of 50 g of glucose elicited an exaggerated rise in plasma PP in diabetic patients as compared with the response in normal subjects. This exaggerated PP response to oral glucose loading was partially but significantly improved after the treatment, with an augmented response of plasma insulin. These results indicate the existence of abnormal PP secretion in diabetes mellitus which is probably caused by metabolic or endocrine derangements.
