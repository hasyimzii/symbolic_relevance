Effect of streptozotocin induced diabetes on renal ornithine decarboxylase activity.
The effects of streptozotocin(SZ) induced diabetes on renal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, the rate limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, were studied. Sixteen hours after the injection of SZ, renal ODC activity increased 50% above that of the vehicle injected controls. The maximum increase in activity  600%  was observed from 24 to 72 h after SZ. Within a week, ODC activity fell below control levels and remained suppressed during a 3 wk follow up period. Insulin treatment within 10 h of the SZ injection prevented the increase of ODC activity; however, insulin given after enzyme activity had increased did not restore ODC activity to control levels. The early increase of ODC activity occurred in the presence of mild hyperglycemia without ketosis or hyperglucagonemia, but the levels were much higher in severely diabetic animals. Adrenalectomy, performed before the initial increase in enzyme activity, prevented the subsequent increase in diabetic animals; however, when adrenalectomy was performed after the enzyme had increased, enzyme activity did not normalize.
