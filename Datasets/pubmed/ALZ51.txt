Application of a test of cellular fusion in Creutzfeldt Jakob and Alzheimer diseases (author's transl).
We have tested the in vitro cellular fusing activity of brain suspensions from the following categories of patients: CJD (53 cases), Alzheimer (23 cases), and non neurological controls (25 cases). CSF specimens were also available for 26 of the CJD patients. Our results show that 65 75 per cent of CJD brain specimens induce cell fusion but that this activity is only rarely reflected in matched CSF specimens. Among other types of degenerative neurological diseases, a sharp distinction appeared between familial Alzheimer disease, which caused fusion at nearly the same frequency as CJD, and sporadic Alzheimer disease, which was not significantly different from the non neurological control specimens. The biological and clinical significance of these results are discussed.
