Cellular uptake of the tat protein from human immunodeficiency virus.
While developing an assay to measure the activity of the tat protein from human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1), we discovered that the purified protein could be taken up by cells growing in tissue culture and subsequently trans activate the viral promoter. Trans activation is dramatically increased by a variety of lysosomotrophic agents. For example, trans activation can be detected at tat concentrations as low as 1 nM in the presence of chloroquine. Experiments using radioactive protein show that tat becomes localized to the nucleus after uptake and suggest that chloroquine protects tat from proteolytic degradation. These results raise the possibility that, under some conditions, tat might act as a viral growth factor to stimulate viral replication in latently infected cells or alter expression of cellular genes.
