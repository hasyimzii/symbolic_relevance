Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides are potent sequence nonspecific inhibitors of de novo infection by HIV.
Phosphorothioate homo oligodeoxynucleotides have recently been found to protect ATH 8 cells against the cytopathic effect of de novo infection by HIV. The effect is dose and chain length dependent, with a maximum effect seen for 21 28 mers. We have now synthesized a series of phosphorothioate oligomers with mixed based sequences and found that all of them have a dose dependent cytoprotective effect that is maximal at an oligomer concentration of about 1 2 microM. The least effective sequences contain only A or T, and the most effective sequences have 40% GC content or greater. The results also confirm the length effect, namely that 21 mers are more cytoprotective than 14 mers.
