Clinical spectrum of HTLV III in humans.
We have studied the clinical and laboratory manifestations of infection with human T cell lymphotropic virus type III in various epidemiological cohorts. The spectrum of infection ranges from an asymptomatic but apparently contagious carrier state to severe immunodeficiency with opportunistic infections and neoplasms. Study of virus structure function relationships and host response to viral infection in hosts with different clinical manifestations should provide strategies for therapeutics and vaccine development as well as enhance our understanding of the biology of human retroviruses.
