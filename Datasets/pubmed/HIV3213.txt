Oral "hairy" leukoplakia  clinical early manifestation of HTLV III infection.
Oral "hairy" leukoplakia is a new clinical entity and represents an early manifestation of the HTLV III infection. The white lesions develop rather quickly; they are found principally on the lateral border of the tongue. The lesions are slightly raised and show a corrugated or "hairy" surface. This leukoplakia is associated with both papillomavirus and a herpes type virus. A case report is presented and the literature discussed.
