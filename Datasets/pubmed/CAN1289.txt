Cryosurgery in the treatment of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus of the vulva.
Twelve patients with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus of the vulva were treated by  a nitrous oxide cryoprobe. All had had severe itching which was relieved in the post operative period in 75% and for 3 years in 50%. Eight had histologically proven leukoplakia which cleared post operatively in five (62.5%) and remained clear at three years in four (50%). In one patient pruritus, leukoplakia and ultimately squamous carcinoma appeared.
