Memory enhancement: supra additive effect of subcutaneous cholinergic drug combinations in mice.
The amnesias characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and other age related dementias are refractory to conventional pharmacotherapy. A recent treatment strategy is to combine present drugs to improve their memory enhancing effect. We used mice weakly trained on active avoidance in a T maze to compare the effect of cholinergic drugs, given alone and in two drug combinations, on retention test performance. All drugs were injected SC immediately after training. Memory retention was tested 1 week later. A dose response curve was determined for each of four drugs (arecoline, edrophonium, oxotremorine, tacrine) and for each of the six possible two drug combinations. Each drug and each combination improved retention test performance up to an optimal dose; the improvement decreased with further increases in dose. A striking reduction (66.2% 95.7%) in the optimal dose for enhanced retention was observed with these two drug combinations.
