Cortical somatostatin like immunoreactivity in cases of Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
The activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the concentration of somatostatin like immunoreactive material (SLI) have been measured in 8 brain regions from 12 normal individuals and 12 cases of presenile and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. ChAT activity was significantly lower in all 8 brain regions of demented patients and the SLI concentration was significantly reduced in 7 of the the 8. There were correlations between the extent of the reductions of ChAT activity and SLI concentration in four brain regions, and a greater reduction of parietal cortex SLI in younger patients than in the more elderly.
