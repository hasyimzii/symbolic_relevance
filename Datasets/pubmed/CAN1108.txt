Macrophage content and immunogenicity of C57BL/6J and BALB/cByJ methylcholanthrene induced sarcomas.
A total of 33 methylcholanthrene induced sarcomas, growing in C57BL/6J or BALB/cByJ mice, were tested for their immunogenicity and for their relative macrophage content. No relationship was demonstrated between these two characteristics. These results suggest that the direct correlation between macrophage content and immunogenicity demonstrated in rat tumor model systems may not hold for other systems.
