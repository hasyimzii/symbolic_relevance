Excessive carbohydrate intake in pregnancy and neonatal obesity: study in Cap Bon, Tunisia.
A high incidence (over 20%) of obesity was found in 250 neonates living in a rural area of Tunisia, by using weight and ponderal index per gestational age as the nutritional index. Maternal diabetes was probably excluded. Two surveys on nutritional habits  one on the general population and the other on pregnant women  showed a tendency to consume a high carbohydrate and low protein diet. The effect of a badly balanced maternal diet on the fetus is discussed.
