Neurotensin immunoreactivity in post mortem brain is increased in Down's syndrome but not in Alzheimer type dementia.
Neurotensin immunoreactivity and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity were measured in post mortem brain from 10 cases of Down's syndrome (7 aged 53 63 years, one aged 27 years, one aged 16 months and one aged 10 months), 6 cases of Alzheimer type dementia (ATD) and 19 control subjects (13 aged 40 88 years and 6 aged 9 18 months). Neurotensin concentrations in anterior and basal hypothalamus, amygdala, septal area, caudate nucleus and temporal cortex were unaltered in ATD. The concentrations of neurotensin were significantly increased in the caudate nucleus, temporal cortex and frontal cortex in the cases of Down's syndrome aged 53 63 years with the neuropathological features of ATD, and were also increased in the cerebral cortex of the 27 year old, which did not have the neuropathological features of ATD, and in two infant Down's cases. ChAT activity was reduced in the ATD and the 53 63 year old cases of Down's syndrome, but not in the 27 year or 10 month old Down's cases. The increased neurotensin concentrations appear to be a feature of Down's syndrome not related to the presence of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles or to a deficit in ChAT activity.
