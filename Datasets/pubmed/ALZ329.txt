Age differences in Wechsler Memory Scale performance.
Calculated mean scores for older persons utilizing data from previous studies that measured Wechsler Memory Scale performance in healthy samples and compared with those of younger adults and a sample of neurologically impaired aged (N = 384). Statistical analysis indicated that in total raw scores, as well as in all subtest scores but Digit Span, there are significant differences in the performance of different age groups. The degree to which age is associated with subtest performance varies depending on the particular subtest involved. Results are discussed in terms of their clinical implications and current theories of aging and memory.
