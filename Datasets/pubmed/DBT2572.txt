Simplified method for detecting anti insulin antibodies and insulin anti insulin  immune complexes.
A simplified approach for estimating free and total anti insulin antibodies and soluble insulin anti insulin immune complexes in serum has been developed and evaluated. For determination of free anti insulin antibodies, a binding ratio for 125I labeled insulin at fivefold serum dilution is calculated; the binding ratios obtained are reproducible (run to run coefficient of variation, 7.3%) and correlate well with titration of anti insulin antibodies by other techniques (correlation coefficient, 0.9327). Total anti insulin antibody concentrations are determined by calculating the [125I]insulin binding ratio for a sample previously acidified, adsorbed with acid dextran coated charcoal, and neutralized. The difference in binding ratios between two aliquots of the same serum, one diluted 10 fold without manipulation and the second studied at an identical dilution after acidification and removal of free insulin, is taken as an index of the presence of soluble insulin anti insulin immune complexes. Because the tests can be performed at a single dilution, both time and materials are conserved without apparent loss of discrimination between sera with high antibody titers and high concentrations of insulin anti insulin immune complexes and sera with negative titers or low concentrations.
