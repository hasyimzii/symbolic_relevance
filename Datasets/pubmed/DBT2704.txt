Improved outcome following renal transplantation with reduction in the immunosuppression therapy for rejection episodes.
Renal transplantation is superior to hemodialysis in terms of rehabilitation and  cost, but it is offered to only a minority of patients with end stage renal failure because of complications related to immunosuppression therapy. To reduce morbidity, we modified out therapy of patients with transplant rejection from high dose intravenous methylprednisolone (group A: January 1968  September 1972) to lower dose oral prednisone (group B: September 1972  December 1977). Patient survival in group B was significantly improved over that in group A, both in recipients of cadaver transplants (91 per cent versus 81 per cent, respectively, at one year, p less than 0.0009) and in recipients of transplants from living related donors (99 per cent versus 86 per cent, respectively, at one year p less than 0.001). The improvement in patient survival was the result of a significant decrease in the incidence of infections. Patients with multiple rejection episodes, a very high risk group, experienced an 18 per cent increase in patient survival in group B. With reduction and rapid tapering of corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with acute rejection and curtailment of the therapy of patients with multiple rejection episodes, survival after renal transplantation becomes comparable to that following hemodialysis; in addition, graft function is not compromised.
