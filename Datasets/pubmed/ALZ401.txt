Tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism in the temporal lobe of patients dying with senile dementia of Alzheimer type.
There is a defect in tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism in brains from subjects with  senile dementia of Alzheimer type compared to age matched controls. This defect results in lowered total biopterin concentrations in brain. Brains from subjects with senile dementia of Alzheimer type retain their ability to synthesis neopterin and have normal dihydropteridine reductase activity, indicating a specific loss of ability to convert dihydroneopterin triphosphate to tetrahydrobiopterin.
