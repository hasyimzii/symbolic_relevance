A fluorescent probe for rapid detection of estrogen receptors.
Fluorescein conjugates to estradiol 17 beta by the sixth carbon (6 FE) and to estrone by the 17th carbon (17 FE) were used to detect estrogen receptors (ERs) in breast cancer tissue sections and in cultured cell lines (human mammary carcinoma MCF 7 and Copenhagen rat prostatic tumor R3327 AT). 17 FE was found to interact with ERs better than 6 FE by biochemical and histochemical techniques. Thin layer chromatography analysis of ethanolic extracts of 17 FE incorporated in tissues and cultured cells showed that over 95% of 17 FE was not metabolized. We concluded that the fluorescence observed in tissue sections and cultured cells was due to 17 FE and not to fluorescein dissociated from the conjugate. Analysis of 65 human breast cancer showed that 74% of the cases were positive for specific 17 FE uptake and 26% were negative. The fluorescence was consistently brighter in the ductal and glandular epithelial cells than in the stroma. specific 17 FE uptake in the nucleoli was observed in MCF 7 and in R3327 AT tumor cells in in vitro cultures, suggesting that these nucleolar estrogen receptors may play a key role in the mechanism of estrogen action. Problems of fluorescence quantitation in tissue sections and cells are discussed.
