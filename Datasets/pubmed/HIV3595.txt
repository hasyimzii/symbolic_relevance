Employing persons with disabilities.
Training, job accommodation, and modification will be key factors in the placement of persons with disabilities in the public and private sectors. It is projected that the role of the occupational health nurse will be further extended to educating management and employees about the inclusion of the disabled into the work force. People with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or those carrying the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), are currently supported at the worksite as employable.
