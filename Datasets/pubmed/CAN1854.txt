Cellular cytotoxicity in tumor bearing mice after transfer of normal or tumor sensitized lymphoid cells.
The present investigations are a continuation of those indicating that the administration to normal inbred C3HeB/ FeJ mice of syngeneic tumor sensitized cells or cells from F344 Mai rats (xenogeneic) sensitized to mouse tumor imparted "information" that resulted in the production of tumor specific cytotoxic cells by recipients. Current findings revealed that normal but not tumor sensitized spleen cells when transferred to syngeneic tumor bearing recipients enhanced the cytotoxicity ofrom F344 Mai rats (xenogeneic) sensitized to mouse tumor imparted "information" that resulted in the production of tumor specific cytotoxic cells by recipients. Current findings revealed that normal but not tumor sensitized spleen cells when transferred to syngeneic tumor bearing recipients enhanced the cytotoxicity of lymphoid cells in the recipients. This enhanced cytotoxicity was specific for the immunizing tumor. Inoculation of normal or tumor sensitized lymph node cells failed to produce such an effect. Our present and previous findings suggested that in the presence of a tumor, uncommitted cells that reside in the spleen and that are available for recruitment and "instruction" may become depleted, whereas no comparable deficit may exist in cells that are capable of information transfer.
