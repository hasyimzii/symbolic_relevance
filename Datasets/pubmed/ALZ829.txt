Neuropeptide Y like immunoreactivity in neuritic plaques of Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimer's disease, a form of senile dementia, is characterized by the presence  of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles throughout the cortex and hippocampus. This study demonstrates the presence of neuropeptide Y like immunoreactivity within 10 20% of neuritic plaques. Neuropeptide Y is a 36 amino acid peptide which is distributed unevenly throughout the brain and has an interneuronal location.
