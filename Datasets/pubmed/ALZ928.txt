Remarks on the drug treatment of demented patients.
Drug holidays are mandatory during longlasting therapy of demented patients with  neuroleptics because of slowed drug metabotisme and high succeptability for sedative side effects. Despite claims to the contrary nootropic drugs are no effective therapy of dementia in every day praxis. Based on the cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's typ dementia and on the results of pilotstudies, cholinergic therapies will probably improve effectively the behavior of some dements on the future.
