HLA and insulin dependent diabetes in South African negroes.
The HLA antigens of 57 South African negroes with juvenile onset, insulin dependent diabetes were determined. The frequency of B8 was increased (29.8% VS 13.9%) as was the frequency of B14 (17.5% vs 6.1%). The frequency of patients with either one of these cross reactive antigens was significantly increased after correction for the number of antigens tested (45.6% VS 19.2%, P (corrected) < 0.005).
