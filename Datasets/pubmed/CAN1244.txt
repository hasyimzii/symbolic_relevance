The ZYPAB image processing system for cytologic prescreening for cervical cancer.
The ZYPAB (Zytologisches Prescreeing durch Automatische Bildverarbeitung) system  was developed over the past eight years as a special application of our microscope image processing system. The data acquisition device consists of a commercial research microscope and an image dissector camera. The diagnostic decision on the entire sample is based on the evaluation of 18 nuclear features. The result of classification is statistical information on the probability of coincidence of an unknown case with the normal object sample. In addition, the program automatically assesses the number of isolated epithelial cell nuclei. With this information it is possible to differentiate between tumor suggestive, negative and inadequate smears.
