Large vessel disease in a black diabetic: a case report.
A case of a middle aged Black woman with maturity on set diabetes is described. The patient had had a cerebrovascular accident and subsequently developed thrombosis of the descending thoracic aorta, with extension into the left subclavian artery and emboli in the right femoral and left brachial arteries. Occlusive large vessel disease rarely occurs in Black diabetics. Vascular disorders and haemostatic factors in Black and White diabetics are discussed.
