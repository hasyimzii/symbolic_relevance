Epidemiology of human T lymphotropic virus type III and the risk of the acquired  immunodeficiency syndrome.
The discovery of human T lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy associated virus (HTLV III/LAV) has opened a window to the understanding of the spectrum of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related clinical syndromes. Analysis of risk factors for seropositivity has shown that HTLV III is transmitted most efficiently via routes that involve close personal contact or parenteral exposure. Longitudinal studies have shown that HTLV III infection has a long latent period. The prevalence of AIDS in different geographic areas and among different risk groups appears to depend in part on duration of exposure. Co factors for AIDS outcome such as manner and route of exposure, underlying immune status, and host susceptibility are also likely to play a role in risk.
