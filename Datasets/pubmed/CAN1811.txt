A clinical test to differentiate aneurysmal bone cyst from other benign osseous cystic lesions.
Intracystic pressures of benign osseous cysts recorded with a spinal manometer help to diagnose aneurysmal bone cysts. Sixteen benign osseous cystic lesions in various sites were subjected to manometer pressure readings. Twelve proved to be aneurysmal bone cysts. The results are recorded.
