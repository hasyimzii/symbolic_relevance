High resolution eye movement recording in the assessment of neurologic complications in HIV 1 infection.
HIV 1 related brain disease gives rise to widespread eye movement abnormalities that include impairment of fixation, saccadic speed and accuracy, antisaccadic generation and smooth pursuit function. Quantitative high resolution recording of eye movements is a valuable, non invasive technique both for measuring the severity and progression of the AIDS dementia complex and the early detection of neurologic dysfunction in asymptomatic HIV seropositive subjects or in patients with AIDS. In particular, it may be of use in neurologically at risk patients requiring antiviral therapy and in monitoring the neurologic responses to such treatment.
