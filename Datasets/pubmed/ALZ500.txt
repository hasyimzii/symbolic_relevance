Effects of aging on cerebral blood flow in dementia.
Regional cerebral blood flow values were measured utilizing the 133Xe inhalation  method in patients with multi infarct dementia (MID) (n = 22, age 67.4 +/  9.8 years), in patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) (n = 36, age 63.8 +/  8.0) and in age matched normal healthy volunteers (n = 50, age 67.5 +/  9.3). Mean hemispheric gray matter flow values were significantly reduced in MID (P less than 0.01) and SDAT (P less than 0.01) patients compared with age matched normal volunteers. In normal volunteers, mean flow values showed gradual declines with advancing age (r =  0.44, P less than 0.005). In MID patients there were significant decreases in flow values with advancing age (r =  0.43, P less than 0.05), but flow values were consistently lower than in age matched normals. Reductions of flow were most evident in the distribution of both middle cerebral arteries. Unlike MID patients, patients with SDAT had diffusely reduced flow values over all age ranges without correlation with advancing age. Reductions of mean flow values in both dementia groups were significantly correlated with severity of dementia (P less than 0.05 for both groups). Cerebral blood flow reductions related to the aging process also contribute to decreased cerebral perfusion in patients with MID. This is not true in SDAT, where the disease process itself pre empts cerebral blood flow reductions attributable to aging.
