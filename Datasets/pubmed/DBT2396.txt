Effects of diabetes on oxidative decarboxylation of branched chain keto acids.
Oxidative decarboxylation is the first irreversible step in the degradation of leucine. The effect of streptozotocin diabetes on this reaction was studied in cell free rat liver preparations, using [1 14C]alpha ketoisocaproate as substrate. Diabetes increased the branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) activity (per g liver or per mg protein) of homogenates, but the ratios of homogenate BCKD activity to other mitochondrial markers remained unchanged. A cytosolic branched chain ketoacid decarboxylase activity (15 22% of homogenate activity), which did not require NAD, CoA, or NADP, was also increased in diabetics. Insulin treatment of diabetics normalized enzyme activity in all fractions. The apparent Km of BCKD in homogenates was 43 45 microM; diabetes increased the apparent Vmax from 165 nmol x min 1 x g tissue 1 to 260 nmol x min 1 x g 1. In contrast, the Km for cytosolic alpha ketoisocaproate decarboxylation was 270 microM in controls, and diabetes resulted in both a lower Km (210 microM) and a higher Vmax. Adrenalectomy did not affect activity in homogenates from controls, but partially reversed the diabetes associated increase. Glucagon pretreatment of controls did not affect activity. In summary, distinct mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes decarboxylate alpha ketoisocaproate in liver. The increased hepatic capacity of diabetic rats to degrade the carbon skeleton of leucine is attributed mainly to a relative increase in mitochondrial mass.
