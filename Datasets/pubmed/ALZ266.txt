Immunological indices in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with presenile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
In ten patients with presenile dementia of the Alzheimer type and in a control group the levels of the different immunoglobulins were determined in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and gel electrophoretic techniques used to determine possible oligoclonal bands in the gamma globulin region. There is no indication that patients with Alzheimer disease produce immunoglobulins within the central nervous system.
