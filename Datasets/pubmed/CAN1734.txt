Cell surface molecules of Friend erythroleukemias: decrease in T200 glycoprotein  expression after induction.
Monoclonal antibodies against the Thy 1 and T200 glycoproteins were used to study the expression of cell surface molecules on mouse hematopoietic cell lines. Friend erythroleukemias express T200 glycoprotein but do not express significant amounts of Thy 1 glycoprotein on their cell surface. The rate of T200 glycoprotein synthesis in maximally induced Friend erythroleukemia 745.6 cells is less than 10% that in noninduced cells, although total protein synthesis shows only a twofold decline and induced cells express 2 6 fold less T200 glycoprotein on their surface compared to noninduced cells. T200 glycoprotein expression is reduced in a variant cell line obtained by selection for growth in dimethylsulfoxide, showing that the reduction in T200 glycoprotein synthesis characteristic of induced cells is an event that can be dissociated from commitment and hemoglobin synthesis. Analysis of T200 glycoprotein negative cell lines, isolated by cytotoxic immunoselection against T200 glycoprotein, indicates that the presence of T200 glycoprotein on the cell surface is not necessary for induction of hemoglobin synthesis and terminal differentiation of Friend erythroleukemias.
