HIV infection in healthy persons in Uganda.
The results of several serological surveys, carried out in Uganda in the last 2 years, show that HIV infection is present in a number of different groups of individuals. There is a wide range of seropositivity (0 to 67.7%) seen within Uganda. In the sexually inactive, whether primary school pupils or residents of old people's homes, no serological evidence of HIV infection was found. In young adults in Kampala the HIV seropositivity ranged from 10.6 to 24.1%, whereas in rural adults the range was from 1.4 to 12.5%. Those with the greatest number of lifetime sexual partners had the highest rate of seropositivity, ranging from 32 to 67.7%. These rates are probably dependent on a number of factors, including sexuality.
