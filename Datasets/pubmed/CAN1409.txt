Selective embolization of symptomatic contralateral metastases in treatment of carcinoma of the kidney: report of 2 cases.
We report 2 cases of contralateral metastases secondary to renal carcinoma that had been treated with nephrectomy. Selective embolization was done in 1 case because hematuria did not respond to medical treatment. The lower two thirds of the remaining kidney were embolized. The other patient presented with severe pain that was not relieved by medical treatment of radiotherapy and, therefore, selective embolization of the remaining kidney was performed. In both cases selective embolization conserved satisfactory renal function and nephrectomy was not necessary.
