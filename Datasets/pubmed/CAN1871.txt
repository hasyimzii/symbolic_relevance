Relative importance of bacterial and mammalian nitroreductases for niridazole mutagenesis.
Niridazole is a nitrothiazole anthelmintic agent used to treat schistosomiasis. Its antibacterial activity was found to require the presence of the nitro group; a synthetic desnitro analog was completely inactive. Niridazole was mutagenic for Salmonella tester strains TA1538, TA98, and TA100, suggesting that it was both a frame shift  and a base substitution type mutagen. It was effective under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, while similar testing of the desnitro niridazole produced consistently negative results. Addition of rat liver S 9 fraction under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions did not enhance mutagenicity. However, since bacterial killing limited the dose of niridazole to 0.33 microgram/plate in standard tester strains (1/20 Km for the mammalian liver enzymes), further studies were performed using niridazole resistant, histidine dependent mutants derived from strains TA98 and TA100. These mutants were found to be nitroreductase deficient and to resist the mutagenic effects of niridazole, in the presence or absence of S 9, up to concentrations of 10 microgram/plate. In addition, even at niridazole concentrations of up to 100 microgram/plate, rat liver S 9 was ineffective in enhancing the mutagenicity of niridazole. These results suggest that the mutagenicity of niridazole is dependent on its aromatic nitro group and a specific bacterial nitroreductase.
