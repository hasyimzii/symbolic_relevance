Effect of calcium dobesilate on permeation of plasma proteins in diabetic patients.
The effect of six months of treatment with 750 mg calcium dobesilate on sedimentation rate blood count, cholesterol, triglycerides, platelet aggregation factor, total protein, electrophoretic distribution of serum protein concentrations, and kinetics of intravenous albumin marked with 131I was established in 35 diabetics with a mean duration of diabetes of 9.8 years. There was significant intravascular retention of 131I albumin and significant increase of serum albumin, beta globulins and total protein after treatment. The other parameters remained unchanged. The results are interpreted as evidence of lowering of the increased transcapillary permeability within the vascular system seen in diabetics.
