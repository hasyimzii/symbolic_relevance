Blood testis barrier in men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic eunuchoidism and postpuberal pituiary failure.
Immature type Sertoli cells in the testes of idiopathic hypogonadotropic eunuchoidism (17 30 years of age) had no specialized junctions. The specialized Sertoli junctions that blocked the penetration of lanthanum were formed six months to two years after hCG treatment (5000 IU twice a week) in patients of hypogonadotropic eunuchoidism. In two patients with postpubertal pituitary failure (one had a ectopic pinealoma, irradiated one year ago, and the other had a pituitary adenoma, hypophysectomized four years ago), the ultrastructural integrity of these Sertoli junctions was maintained. Therefore, it may be suggested that the development of the blood testis barrier is dependent on gonadotropins, but the maintenance of the blood testis barrier is not.
