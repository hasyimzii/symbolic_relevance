Pulmonary complications in AIDS.
Adult patients suffering from infection with the HIV virus acquire pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in nearly 80 per cent and in the half of all patients the basic disease AIDS has been detected by this lung infection. In childhood the patients with AIDS show most frequently interstitial lung diseases due to pneumocystis carinii or to lymphoid interstitial pneumonia. Also recurrent bacterial pneumonia may frequently occur, likewise infections with the cytomegalovirus or the Epstein Barr virus causing atypical pneumonia. The identification of the aetiology of these lung diseases is more difficult in children than in adults. In future it should be necessary to include more often AIDS as the basic disease into the differential diagnostic considerations in cases of such lung infections.
