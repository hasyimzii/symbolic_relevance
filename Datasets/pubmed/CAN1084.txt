Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium in Israel, 1960 1968.
Data gathered during an epidemiologic study of endometrial cancer in Israel are presented. In the nine year period of this survey, 877 new cases of primary cancer of the endometrium were diagnosed, representing an incidence of 17.8/100,00 females over the age of 25. Two thirds of the patients were in the sixth and seventh decades of life at diagnosis of the tumor. Endometrial carcinoma was two to three times more prevalent in women of European American origin than in those of Asian African Background. In 85% of the patients, diagnosis was made while the disease was in Stage I. A strong correlation was found between endometrial cancer, diabetes (14%), hypertension (18%), and infertility (25%). The five year survival rate in the present survey was 69.2%. Factors affecting prognosis are clinical stage of the disease at diagnosis, degree of myometrial invasion, tumor differentiation, age of the patient, and type of treatment.
