Toxic hepatic failure in newborn foals.
Eight foals, 2 to 5 days of age, with similar clinical signs and laboratory and pathologic findings, died from hepatic failure. The predominant clinical signs were depression and icterus. Abnormally high values were found for plasma ammonia content, aromatic to branch chain amino acid ratio, total serum bilirubin content, gamma glutamyl transferase activity, alkaline phosphatase activity, and PCV; partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were prolonged. Some foals had high sorbitol dehydrogenase activity. These laboratory findings were suggestive of subacute hepatic disease and failure. Predominant pathologic findings were limited to the liver and brain. The livers were less than half the expected size for 2  to 5 day old foals, had prominent bile ductule proliferation, hepatic cell necrosis, and mild periportal fibrosis. These findings suggested both prenatal and postnatal diseases caused by exposure to a hepatoxin. The predominant lesion in the brain was the presence of Alzheimer type II astrocytes, which are characteristic of hepatoencephalopathy. Although the periportal fibrosis was suggestive of in utero exposure to a toxin, epidemiologic information suggested that the hepatic failure more likely resulted from oral inoculation of a microorganism culture product at birth. The same disease was reproduced in 2 newborn foals by feeding this product.
