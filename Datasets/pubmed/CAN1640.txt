Serum electrophoresis and immunoglobulin concentrations in cows with lymphoma.
Changes in the serum electrophoretic patterns and immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations were examined in cows with lymphoma, in clinically normal cows, and in cows with various inflammatory conditions. Cows with lymphoma had moderately increased concentrations of alpha 2 globulin which were significantly different from concentrations in normal animals (P less than or equal to 0.01) and in animals with inflammatory conditions (P less than or equal to 0.05). This was possibly due to the increase in acute phase reactant proteins which occurs with inflammation and neoplasia; however, there was the suggestion that these alpha 2 globulins may be qualitatively different in animals with neoplasia. beta 2 Globulins were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) decreased in cows with lymphoma, and this was attributed to lower concentrations of Ig observed in this group. All Ig classes, except IgA, were decreased in cows with lymphoma, but the greatest decrease was observed in the IgM class.
