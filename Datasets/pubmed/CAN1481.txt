Xenotropic virus expression and susceptibility to 3 methylcholanthrene induced cancer.
This paper reports the lack of genetic linkage between spontaneous production of  substantial amounts of infectious xenotropic (X tropic) virus and the susceptibility to chemically induced cancers in two inbred strains of mice, NZB/BLNJ and 129/J, and their genetic crosses. The parental strains and F1, backcross, and F2 progeny between these two strains were partially splenectomized to ascertain X tropic viral status and were subsequently treated s.c. with 500 microgram of 3 methylcholanthrene in trioctanoin. Progeny from second backcrosses [(F1 X 129) X 129] were also tested for their X tropic viral status and susceptibility to 3 methylcholanthrene carcinogenesis. Mice were observed for evidence of fibrosarcomas at the site of inoculation over a 10 month period. In this genetic system, spontaneous production of high titers of X tropic virus segregated as a single autosomal dominant gene. Susceptibility to 3 methylcholanthrene induced fibrosarcomas did not segregate in these crosses, and susceptibility did not correlate with the degree of X tropic virus expression.
