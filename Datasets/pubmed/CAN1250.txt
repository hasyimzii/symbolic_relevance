Promutagen activation by rodent liver postmitochondrial fractions in the L5178Y/TK cell mutation assay.
Individual S9 microsomal fractions prepared from normal livers of 8 rodent species or strains and from 1 rat strain pretreated with Aroclor 1254, were used to metabolize the promutagens N acetyl 2 aminofluorene, 1,2 benzanthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, and 3 methylcholanthrene to active forms during 3 h co incubation in the presence of L5178Y/TK+/  cells. The 8 compatible S9 preparations all converted each of the 4 chemical carcinogens into active mutagens with varied efficiencies except for the Aroclor induced rat S9/benzanthracene combination which produced only weak activity. Aroclor induction did not notably enhance the mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene or 3 methylcholanthrene beyond that activity mediated by the other non induced preparations. Syrian hamster S9 and, to a lesser degree, C57BL/6J mouse S9 were exceptionally active in converting N acetyl 2 aminofluorene to toxic and mutagenic metabolites. One source of Swiss mouse liver (Blu : Ha ICR) provided the most active S9 when tested with the 3 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In general, mutagenicity and cytotoxicity were roughly correlated within S9 + promutagen combinations. Almost all of the methylcholanthrene metabolizing activity was lost by the 12th week when Aroclor induced rat S9 was held at  20 degrees C, yet this activity remained constant when similar S9 was stored at  80 degrees C for 14 weeks. Surprisingly, some S9 sources including the induced rat liver preparation converted anthracene to a weak or border line mutagen. The activation of both 1,2 benzanthracene and anthracene may be linked within each species or strain although Aroclor induction enhanced anthracene mutagenicity yet attenuated the mutagenicity of 1,2 benzanthracene. Collectively, these data underscore the current inchoate state of development for S9 coupled somatic cell mutation assays.
