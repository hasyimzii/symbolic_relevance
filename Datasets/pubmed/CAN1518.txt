Split course radiation therapy: effects on pulmonary function in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma.
Pulmonary function studies were made in 15 patients with unresectable bronchogenic carcinoma treated by split course megavoltage radiation. Forced vital capacity and forced respiratory volume per second were measured before starting each of the first and second phases of the split course therapy, and at 2 weeks and 12 weeks after completion of treatment. Improvement in ventilatory functions was noted in more than half of the patients. Adverse effects on lung function appeared to be minimal.
