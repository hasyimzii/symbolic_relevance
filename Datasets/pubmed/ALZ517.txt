The olfactory bulbs in Alzheimer's disease.
The olfactory bulbs have been examined in patients with Alzheimer's disease and compared with those in elderly undemented and younger undemented control patients. In Alzheimer's disease neurofibrillary tangles were found in the anterior olfactory nucleus but not elsewhere in the olfactory bulb. Cell loss in the anterior olfactory nucleus was also found in Alzheimer's disease. It is clear that the olfactory sensory pathway is pathologically affected in Alzheimer's disease and would merit further study.
