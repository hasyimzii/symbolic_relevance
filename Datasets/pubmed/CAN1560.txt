Cancer of the breast in pregnancy.
The Authors discuss the incidence of mammary carcinoma in the course of pregnancy and its treatment. On the strength of their own experience as well as in the light of published data, they advocate prompt and complete local and regional treatment by surgery and irradiation whenever possible. In their opinion, the concomitant pregnancy does not constitute a contraindication.
