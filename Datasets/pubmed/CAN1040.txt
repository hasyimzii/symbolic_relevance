Psychopathological manifestations in the early diagnosis of cerebral tumours in  children (author's transl).
The psychopathology of cerebral tumours in childhood is divided into syndromes of diminished consciousness, diffuse organic psychosyndromes, regression or retardation and local cerebral psychosyndromes. 15 unselected paediatric patients suspected of having a cerebral tumour owing to psychiatric symptoms were admitted for psychopathological and psychopathometric investigations. It is not possible to detect connections between symptoms and localisation by psychopathological examinations, but skill disorders serve as early unmistakeable pointers to local cerebral lesions. Specific differentiation of psychopathometric investigations give an indication of possible future improvements in tumour localisation.
