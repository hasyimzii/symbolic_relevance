Human immunodeficiency virus gp120 glycoprotein detected by a monoclonal antibody to a synthetic peptide.
A chemically synthesized peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence 503 532 of gp160 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was used to generate monoclonal antibodies reactive with the env glycoprotein gp120. One monoclonal antibody, 120 1, was isolated that reacted with the peptide and with HIV antigen(s). Western blot analysis showed reactivity with two bands of 120 kDa and 88 kDa. 120 1 reacted in indirect immunofluorescence with 15 20% of infected human T cell line A3.01 as early as 4 days post in vitro infection, 2 3 days prior to detectable reverse transcriptase activity in supernatant fluids.
