Effects of lesions in the amygdala and periventricular hypothalamus on striatal somatostatin like immunoreactivity.
Somatostatin has been found in substantial amounts in the basal ganglia by radioimmunoassay and has been demonstrated in both neurons and nerve terminals. Since the levels of somatostatin have been shown to vary in Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease it was of interest to see whether such changes could be produced experimentally. Lesions of the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and knife cuts adjacent to this nucleus had no effect on striatal somatostatin like immunoreactivity (SLI). Similarly lesions of medio dorsal frontal cortex, and those isolating pyriform cortex or the olfactory bulb had no effect on striatal SLI. Removal of the amygdala resulted in significant increases in SLI in the ipsilateral striatum and nucleus accumbens, suggesting loss of an inhibitory interaction. Stria terminalis lesions failed to reproduce this effect suggesting that it is mediated via amygdalo striatal projections traveling in the dorsal longitudinal bundle. Other findings support a somatostatin projection to the amygdala from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and one from the amygdala to the ventromedial hypothalamus.
