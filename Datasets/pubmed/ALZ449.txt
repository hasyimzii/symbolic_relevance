Frontal lobe syndromes in (pre )senile dementias of the Alzheimer type: a correlative statistical study.
A group of gerontopsychiatric patients suffering from mild to severe dementia was studied. Clinical instruments were a psychological assessment system and a battery of tests. Structural changes of the brain were detected by computerized tomography. A number of correlations between clinical and morphological variables was found. The statistical analysis of most of the variables correlating with the CT determinants of the frontal lobe (Huckman number, width of the frontal interhemispheric fissure) revealed plausibility consistent with the classical frontal lobe syndrome. The relations of the remaining items with the symptomatology of normal pressure hydrocephalus are critically discussed.
