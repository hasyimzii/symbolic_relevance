Gigantiform cementoma: review of the literature and a case report.
Gigantiform cementoma is a very rare lesion in the jaw. A 64 year old caucasian female who presented with this condition is reported and the relevant literature reviewed. The difficulty of making a definitive diagnosis on histological grounds is discussed. An attempt has been made to analyse the lesion biochemically in order to confirm its cemental origin.
