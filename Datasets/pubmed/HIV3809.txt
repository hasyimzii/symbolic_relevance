Imogene King's theory: a nursing case study of a psychotic client with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
The nursing theory of Imogene King provided an effective framework for viewing the complex interactions that occurred when a psychotic client with newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus infection (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome related complex) was admitted to a general psychiatric unit. The interacting systems identified in King's theory assisted in the evaluation of the relationship that formed between the client and the nurses and provided a plan for action that led to the successful achievement of nursing care goals.
