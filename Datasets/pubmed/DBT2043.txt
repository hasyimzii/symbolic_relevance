Fetal breathing movements and maternal hyperoxia.
The effect of maternal inhalation of 50 per cent oxygen upon fetal breathing movements was investigated. No significant effect was noted in patients with normal pregnancies or in those complicated by insulin dependent diabetes or mild pre eclampsia. A significant increase in fetal breathing movements was observed in those pregnancies complicated by either severe pre eclampsia or fetal growth retardation.
