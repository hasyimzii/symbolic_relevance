Congenital anophthalmia associated with intracranial germinoma.
A 14 year old boy with anophthalmia presented evidence of hypothalamic dysfunction. He was found to have a third ventricular germinoma, probably pineal. This case is interesting in view of a previous case report of the association of anophthalmia and a germ cell tumor (teratoma), and suggests a possible causal relationship between this malformation and germ cell neoplasms, bith of which probably arise early in development.
