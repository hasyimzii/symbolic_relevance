We report our experience with 209 HIV positive patients in different stages. A retrospective study (n = 181) showed the high frequency of lymphadenopathy, inflammatory diseases of mouth, pharynx, and esophagus (especially candidiasis) as well as other diseases such as sinusitis. A retrospective study by radiology (n = 28) showed inflammatory changes in the paranasal sinuses in patients with LAS, ARC, and AIDS.
