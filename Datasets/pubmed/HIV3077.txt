Transmission of human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III) by artificial insemination by donor.
Four of eight recipients of artificial insemination (AI) with cryopreserved semen from a symptomless carrier of human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III) were found to have antibody to the virus. One has generalised, persistent lymphadenopathy while the other three remain symptom free 3 years after insemination. Three subsequently became pregnant more than a year after contact with the infected semen; the children, who are now over 1 year of age, are in good health and do not have HTLV III antibodies. These observations emphasise the need for a rigorous screening programme for potential AI donors; they also suggest that fresh semen should not be used in AI. The findings confirm the role of semen in heterosexual transmission of the virus and suggest that in women with HTLV III antibodies pregnancy and subsequent breast feeding does not necessarily lead to infection of the infant.
