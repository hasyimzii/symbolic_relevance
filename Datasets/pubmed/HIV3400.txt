Expression and purification of protein segments encoded by the envelope and 3' orf genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
The pJL6 expression vector and its derivatives, pJLA16 and pANH 1, have been used for the synthesis and high level expression in Escherichia coli of restriction enzyme fragments derived from the envelope and 3' orf genes of the BH10 and BH8 clones, respectively, of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1). These bacterially expressed proteins have been purified to apparent homogeneity by sequential detergent extraction, gel filtration, and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The recombinant proteins have been used for the production of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, and the fusion proteins from the envelope gene are currently being evaluated for use as immunodiagnostic assay reagants.
