Acute renal failure following intravenous urography. 4 cases (author's transl).
The authors report on 4 cases of acute oligo anuric renal failure that followed intravenous urography (IVU) independently from myeloma or cardiovascular collapse. Eighty other cases can be found in the literature. Post IVU renal failure only occurs in patients already presenting with chronic renal insufficiency, those with diabetic or geriatric arterial disease being particularly at risk. It is reversible in only one out of two cases when serum creatinine levels exceed 440 mumol/l. The various triiodide contrast media with a high osmolality are equally nephrotoxic. The pathophysiology and prevention of this complication of IVU are discussed.
