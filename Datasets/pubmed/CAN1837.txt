Dermoid cyst of the mandible.
A mid line cyst of the mandible is described which possessed the histological features of a dermoid cyst. This appears to be the first fully documented example of a totally intra osseous dermoid cyst in the mandible. The pathogenesis of the present lesion is discussed in relation to both the odontogenic and the non odontogenic cysts that may occur in the mandibular mid line.
