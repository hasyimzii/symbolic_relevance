HIV diagnostics in the child  methodology, rational use and value.
The determination of an HIV infection in children of infected mothers has been a  problem for years. Despite the development of new diagnostic methods, this problem has not been simplified. On the contrary, contradictions between the clinical courses and the laboratory results become ever more obvious and complicate the assessment of HIV exposed child's infection status. It is therefore necessary to monitor all HIV exposed children through longitudinal examinations in order to verify or exclude HIV infection.
