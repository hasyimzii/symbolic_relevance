A classification of HTLV III infection based on 75 cases seen in a suburban community.
Since 1981, 75 patients have been seen at our hospital with human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III) infection. We have classified their clinical presentation into Groups 0 to 6. Groups 0 to 3 all have antibody to the Mr 41,000 protein of HTLV III. Group 0 has no evident disease (9 patients), Group 1 has lymphadenopathy with or without exaggerated infection (16 patients), Group 2 has persistent lymphadenopathy with chronic hepatitis B surface antigenemia or profound hypergammaglobulinemia (7 patients), Group 3 has oral candidiasis with or without lymphadenopathy (7 patients). In Group 4 are acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) adults or children (32 patients). Group 5 is a special classification for immunocompromised patients. Group 6 patients have lymphomas and Mr 41,000 protein antibody. Four children were classified separately. Three patients in Group 3 developed Group 4 disorders (AIDS). Four patients in Group 4 developed Group 6 disorders. HTLV III infection spread in families (8 of 36), all from infected mothers to children. In 17 sexual partners, 6 were found to be infected. Five of 6 infected partners were homosexuals. We saw an inordinate number of transfusional AIDS (4 of 29) and 1 of 46 other disorders. Two infants also presented with severe intracranial defects, one with microcephaly and one with cranial calcifications and lucency. HTLV III is spreading with alarming speed.
