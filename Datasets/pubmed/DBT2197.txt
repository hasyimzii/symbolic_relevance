Relationship between hemoglobin A1c and insulin C peptide in anomalies of carbohydrate metabolism.
In this paper, we have compared the results obtained for hemoglobin A1c and C peptide concentrations, was not convenient for the diagnosis of anomalies in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in obesity or in latent diabetes. Nevertheless, hemoglobin A1c allowed us to check carbohydrate metabolism and to discriminate diabetes treated by oral therapy from insulin dependent diabetes; in these latter cases, hemoglobin A1c concentration varied inversely as C peptide concentration as it was shown by the method of factor analysis in particular "principal components analysis". In the control of insulin dependent diabetes in a remission, hemoglobin A1c allowed assessment of the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism after suppression of insulin therapy. Thus, hemoglobin A1c is an index of the adaptation of insulin secretion in anomalies of carbohydrate metabolism.
