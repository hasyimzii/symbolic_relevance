Parasynaptic corpora amylacea in the striatum.
Typical corpora amylacea (CA) were found within synaptic processes in the striatum from subjects with Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. The CA compressed and distorted the synaptic vesicles. It is possible that this unusual synaptic "lesion" is more common than is realized and that a significant number of CA are synapse related before synaptic elements are destroyed.
