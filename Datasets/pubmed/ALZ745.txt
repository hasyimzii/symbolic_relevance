Direct cerebrospinal fluid infusion of bethanechol chloride in Alzheimer's disease: use of an implantable continuous infusion device.
Recently, investigation into an experimental treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease has begun utilizing surgical implantation of a continuous infusion device to deliver a muscarinic agonist, bethanechol chloride, directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The nurse research assistant has been very active in this study being involved in patient evaluation, preoperative and postoperative patient education, collection of data, and refill of the infusion device. The neurosurgical nurse also plays an active role in patient education, immediate preoperative and postoperative care, and careful observation and recording of patient behavior and general well being. Success of continued research based on this protocol will be enhanced by the contributions of the nurse research assistant and neurosurgical nurse familiar with the study and with her/his anticipated role.
