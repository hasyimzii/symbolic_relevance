Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of Alzheimer type. A neuropsychological study.
Neuropsychological performance was investigated in 36 presenile patients with Alzheimer's disease and 35 patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type by using Luria's test methods. The most deteriorated performances in both groups were in memory, intellectual, higher visual and motor functions, and in orientation. The neuropsychological functions deteriorated gradually in the course of the disease process so that the shape of the performance profile was preserved. The progression of the disease seemed to be more rapid in senile patients but neuropsychologically there were no significant differences between Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of Alzheimer type. They seemed to form a continuum of one disease. Luria's neuropsychological investigation turned out to be a useful method in the assessment of at least moderate to severe dementia.
