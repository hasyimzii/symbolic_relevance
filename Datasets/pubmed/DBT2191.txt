Intraocular carbon dioxide laser photocautery.
The indications and contraindications for the use of carbon dioxide laser photocautery at the time of vitrectomy have been reviewed. Indications include posterior retinal tears either in flat or elevated sensory retina; elevated fibrovascular fronds on the optic nerve or elsewhere; flat neovascularization elsewhere, bleeding rubeotic iris vessels. It is also used as a means of panretinal endophotocoagulation. Contraindications include flat disc neovascularization and areas within one disc diameter of the macula and nerve. The advantages and disadvantages of the 10.6 micrometer infrared wavelength of carbon dioxide laser photocautery are discussed.
