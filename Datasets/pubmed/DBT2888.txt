Treatment of hyperlipoproteinaemia in diabetic patients (author's transl).
The efficacy of bezafibrate in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinaemia was investigated in a controlled therapeutic study and compared with "essential" phospholipids (EPL) and placebo. The investigation involved 120 patients, 87 trial protocols could be evaluated statistically. During pretreatment with bezafibrate for three months cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting blood sugar decreased significantly, HDL cholesterol increased significantly. During continued treatment with bezafibrate the investigated parameters remained at their achieved levels, whereas with both EPL and placebo there was a renewed increase of cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood sugar and HbA1 and a decrease of HDL cholesterol to values before bezafibrate treatment. There were no differences between placebo and EPL. Both bezafibrate and EPL were tolerated well.
