Management of the pregnant diabetic: home or hospital, with or without glucose meters?
Thirteen pregnant insulin dependent diabetic patients were allocated to blood glucose self monitoring (meter) or conventionally treated (non meter) groups at 30  31 weeks. A day profile of blood glucose and intermediary metabolite levels was obtained 2 weeks later at home and after routine admission to hospital at 35  36 weeks. Metabolic profiles were also obtained in eight normal pregnant women of equivalent gestational ages admitted to hospital for study. The mean blood glucose and metabolite concentrations in both the meter and non meter groups were similar to those obtained in the non diabetic pregnant women (mean diurnal blood glucose 4.6 +/  1.1 mmol/l, meter group; 5.3 +/  1.5 non meter group; 4.8 +/  0.8 controls). The diabetic control achieved at home was not improved by the use of a meter or admission to hospital (mean glucose at home 5.0 +/  1.3 and 6.3 +/  1.6 mmol/l in hospital). Both the use of a meter and admission to hospital may be valuable in some patients. Neither, however, is essential for the good control of blood glucose in all pregnant diabetics.
