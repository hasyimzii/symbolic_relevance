Human immunodeficiency virus: quantifying the risk of transmission of HIV to dental health care workers.
The potential for the increased risk of transmission of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) from patients to dental health care workers (DHCWs) in the workplace is examined. Based on published and hypothetical risk estimates, the authors conclude that in certain world communities with high prevalence rates of HIV infection (e.g. Central Africa), the potential yearly incidence rate and cumulative long term incidence rate of HIV transmission in the dental workplace could place these workers in a high risk subgroup similar to that of homosexuals. Reported high levels of noncompliance with infection control procedures in the dental care workplace in the United States by these workers suggests the potential for increased risk in communities with high prevalence rates of this disease. Present and past educational efforts toward protection of the DHCW in the United States may be considered inadequate, and even more so when these educational efforts are applied in the world community. Additional efforts should be made by the public health community to alert and educate DHCWs worldwide to the potential for increased HIV transmission in the workplace.
