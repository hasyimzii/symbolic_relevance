Genomic divergence of HIV 2 from Ghana.
Genetic variability in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) has been studied extensively, but the total nucleotide sequence of the HIV 2 genome has been reported only in two strains. For phylogenetic analyses of HIV, the genetic variability of HIV 2 should be investigated. This paper reports the complete nucleotide sequence of an HIV 2 isolate from Ghana, HIV 2[GH 1]. This virus showed approximately 85% homology in overall nucleotide sequence with HIV 2ROD. The amino acid sequence of the gag and pol proteins of HIV 2[GH 1] showed 90% homology with those of HIV 2ROD, but its env gene and central regions were highly variable (more than 20% divergence in amino acids), indicating the presence of extensive genetic heterogeneity in HIV 2. However, the sequences with specific functions were relatively well conserved in these HIV 2 isolates.
