The association of diabetes insipidus with hypoparathyroidism. Addison's disease  and mucocutaneous candidiasis.
A case of central diabetes insipidus is reported in association with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, adrenal failure and mucocutaneous candidiasis. The diabetes insipidus was recognised at the same time as the discovery of aldosterone and cortisol deficiency, and occurred several years after the initial onset of mucocutaneous candidiasis and hypocalcaemia. Control of the diabetes insipidus was achieved initially with nasal aqueous lysine vasopressin and later with desmopressin. The development of diabetes insipidus may be a further aspect of endocrine secretory failure associated with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism.
