Relation between the degree of severity of the dementia and the extent of the manifestation of the pathomorphological changes in the cerebral cortex in senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
A study of 169 patients with senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease included history collection and the examination of the temporal pole. In the preparations impregnated according to Bilshovsky (in strictly the same volume of the cortex), senile plaques, neurofibrillar nodes and neurofibrillar skeletons were counted. Subsequently, the degree of the pathomorphological changes in each case was scored. The collation of the anamnestic and pathomorphological findings demonstrated a marked correlation (r = 0.99 +/  0.0015) between the severity of dementia and the degree of pathomorphological changes in the cortex of the temporal pole.
