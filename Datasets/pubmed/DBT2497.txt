Temporal relationship of tissue somatostatin like immunoreactivity to metabolic changes in genetically obese and diabetic mice.
Somatostatin like immunoreactivity (SRIF LI) content in 2 N acetic acid extracts  of hypothalamus, gastric antrum, and pancreas was measured in genetically obese (C57BL/6J ob/ob and db/db) and diabetic (C57BL/KsJ db/db and ob/ob) mice and normal littermate controls from 5 to 24 wk to determine the relationship of previously reported changes to the development of metabolic abnormalities. Hypothalamic SRIF L concentration was similar in control, diabetic, and obese mice at all ages and increased progressively with age in all groups. Gastric antrum SRIF LI was similar in all groups of mice at all ages. Obese mice gained weight progressively and showed moderate hyperglycemia and marked hyperinsulinemia from 5 wk of age. Pancreatic SRIF LI content in obese (C57BL/6J) animals was similar to that in lean littermate controls, but pancreatic SRIF LI concentration (expressed by weight or protein content) was decreased until 8 (6J ob/ob) and 10 (6J db/db) wk. Diabetic (C57BL/KsJ) mice showed a similar metabolic pattern until 10 wk with no change in pancreatic SRIF LI content or concentration. Thereafter a progressive fall in serum insulin and a marked rise in serum glucose was associated with increasing pancreatic SRIF LI content and concentration. These studies suggest that the genetically hyperphagic syndromes are unassociated with any change in hypothalamic or gastric SRIF LI; that pancreatic SRIF LI increases occur in response to, rather than as the cause of, relative hypoinsulinemia; and that the genetic background of the mice (KsJ or 6J) rather than the mutant gene (db or ob) determines the defect in carbohydrate metabolism and the pancreatic SRIF LI response.
