Refractive change in alloxan diabetic rabbits. Control by flavonoids I.
The rabbit eye is hyperopic by approximately 4D. The induction of diabetes leads  to a further enhancement in the degree of hyperopia. This enhancement is attenuated substantially by flavonoids as inhibitors of aldose reduction. The development of refractive changes in diabetic lens involves aldose reductase catalyzed polyol synthesis.
