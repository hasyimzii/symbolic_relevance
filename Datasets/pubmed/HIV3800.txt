The practical business of treatment  13. Providing health care for drug users?
The majority of drug users neglect their health and have limited access to primary and preventative health care services. A health care team was developed in an attempt to provide health care for drug users, to prevent the spread of HIV and provide health education to the drug users. The health problems were related to injecting drugs, comprising abscesses, peripheral neuropathy and poor peripheral circulation. A high level of past infection with hepatitis B virus was noted, indicating the need for hepatitis B vaccination for drug users.
