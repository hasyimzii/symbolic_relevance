TNM (1978) in bladder cancer: use and abuse.
Modifications to the TNM classification for bladder cancer, introduced in 1979, are described. The use of this classification was evaluated in 106 new patients. It proved to be satisfactory for in situ and papillary tumours but major problems occurred in attempting to separate superficially invasive from deeply invasive tumours. Several aspects of this classification require further consideration and modifications are proposed.
