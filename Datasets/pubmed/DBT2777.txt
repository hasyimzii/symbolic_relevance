Fluorescein angiography in diabetic children.
In 63 diabetic children, aged 10  14 years, with normal ophthalmoscopy, fluorescein angiography revealed slight diabetic retinopathy in maximally three, aged 12  14 years. These findings are discussed in relation to the controversial results published in a few other fluorescein angiographic studies on diabetic children. It is concluded that normal ophthalmoscopy does not exclude the presence of diabetic retinopathy and that fluorescein antiography is a valuable method in the early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.
