AV shunt vessels in diabetic preretinopathy (author's transl).
In 40.8% of 169 eyes affected with diabetic preretinopathy (verified by fluorescein angiography) arteriovenous shunt vessels were found. These vessels occur with significant prevalence in eyes with areas of retinal capillary occlusions, and in cases with diabetes of long duration. There is strong evidence that AV shunts are a consequence of the occurrence of areas lacking capillary perfusion in the retina.
