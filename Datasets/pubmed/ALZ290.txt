The results of complex examination of 489 patients suffering from chronic neuroinfections (progressing forms of tick borne encephalitis, disseminated sclerosis, disseminated encephalomyelitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, etc.) are presented. An analysis of the results of virological, immunological, genetic and electrophysiological examinations, as well as the results of kinesotherapy has demonstrated a definite role of hereditary peculiarities of the immune mechanisms and the nervous system in the genesis of those diseases, as well as certain common features of the pathogenetic mechanisms. This enables one to outline some general principles of the therapy of those diseases.
