Treatable dementias: differential diagnosis and obstacles to recognition.
Dementia is a clinical syndrome with reversible and irreversible causes.

The major obstacles to recognition of treatable dementias are the overdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and the incorrect assumption that dementia is an expected development of aging.
