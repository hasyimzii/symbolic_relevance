Menopausal risk factors (author's transl).
Menopausal disorders coincide with the onset of luteal insufficiency and the resulting relative hyperestrogenism. At this stage the risks to be assessed are mainly related to a worsening of the menstrual syndrome (heaviness of the legs, abdominal distention, water retention, mastodynia, depressive syndrome), cycle changes, or various genital types of hemorrhage requiring investigation for detection of a possible fibroma, hyperplasia, endometriosis, or genital cancer. Once the menopause is settled a reduction in estrogen levels comes with reactive increases in FSM and LM levels, and the principal risk is the development of a cancer. The role of endogenous (obesity, diabetes, Stein Leventhal, adenomatous hyperplasia) or exogenous (prolonged estrogen therapy alone) estrogens has to be evaluated in endometrial cancer. Cancer of the vulva also appears to be more frequent in menopausal women (natural or artificial), as well as cervical cancer and cancer of the breast. There is an apparent increase in cardiovascular risks in untreated menopausal women, but this is still discussed, as to the benefits of estrogen therapy.
