Revised Ischemic Score for diagnosing multi infarct dementia.
Although the validity and reliability of the Ischemic Score (IS) have not yet been established, the IS has become a favored clinical and research tool for use in differentiating Alzheimer type from multi infarct dementia. In its current form, however, the IS has several shortcomings that interfere with standardization. To address these difficulties, the IS has been revised to include: anchoring statements to maximize interrater reliability; a multipoint subscale to allow for assessment of severity; and a confidence subscale to account for varied sources of data. The revised IS aims to stimulate additional research focused on validating and refining such instruments.
