Cholangitis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: report of two cases and review of the literature.
We report the cases of one patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as a result of human immunodeficiency virus type 1/lymphadenopathy associated virus type 1/human T cell lymphotrophic virus type III (HIV 1/LAV 1/HTLV III) infection and of another patient with AIDS related complex caused by human immunodeficiency virus type 2/lymphadenopathy associated virus type 2 (HIV 2/LAV 2) infection, who were suffering from cholangitis. The manifestations and possible mechanisms for cholangitis in these patients and in 10 previously reported similar cases are reviewed.
