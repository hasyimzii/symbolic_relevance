Clinical course of subacute HIV encephalitis.
A subacute encephalitis is increasingly recognized to be the most frequent cerebral manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Contradictory reports are given in the literature concerning its clinical course. In the present study, a group of 19 patients with subacute encephalitis was followed for an average of 210 days. A steady progression of the disease was documented using the Karnofsky index. An advanced disease, rated according to the Walther Reed staging classification, but not isolated immunological parameters such as the ratio of OKT4/8 subsets are associated with more rapid progression of the encephalitis. Age, social status, duration of HIV positivity and antibody titers to cytomegalovirus could not be identified as contributing factors.
