Willingness to participate in a national seroprevalence study of HIV infection.
This paper examines the impact of the social dimension of AIDS on a person's willingness to participate in a hypothetical national seroprevalence study of HIV infection. Data from the AIDS supplement of the 1987 National Health Interview Survey provided information about the sociodemographic characteristics and AIDS related variables and the expressed willingness to participate in a national serosurvey. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to evaluate simultaneously associations between the sociodemographic variables and AIDS related variables with willingness to participate. Results show that those with sociodemographic characteristics most dissimilar from reported AIDS cases were least willing to participate while those with a high knowledge about AIDS, experience of the HIV test or tested people, and higher perceptions of risk were more willing to participate. We found two exceptions to this general result. First, respondents with no knowledge about AIDS, but a higher level of education, were less willing to participate than those with no knowledge and a lower level of education. Second, respondents with a higher perception of risk and a higher level of education were also less willing than those with high perception of risk and less education.
