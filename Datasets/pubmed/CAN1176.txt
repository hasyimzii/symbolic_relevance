Identification and partial characterization of an endogenous form of mouse mammary tumor virus that is transcribed into the virion associated RNA genome.
Restriction mapping demonstrated the presence of several distinct proviral forms  of mouse mammary tumor virus in the genome of GR mice. One of these proviruses (GR MTV 2) was highly amplified in GR 3A cells, a cell line derived from a GR mammary tumor. By the criterion of restriction mapping, the amplified GR MTV 2 provirus found in GR 3A cells was identical to the provirus found in M1.19 cells, a rat cell line infected with virions obtained from GR 3A culture fluid. This result clearly implies that the GR MTV 2 provirus in GR 3A cells was transcribed into the virion associated viral RNA genome. Cleavage of either GR 3A or M1.19 cell DNAs with the restriction enzyme Bg1 II gave rise to a 2.6 x 10(6) dalton GR MTV 2 proviral fragment (ca. 45% of the viral genome). This fragment was isolated and mapped with thirteen restriction enzymes.
