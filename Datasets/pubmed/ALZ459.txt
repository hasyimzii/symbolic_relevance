Monoamine metabolite concentrations in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid of patients with histologically verified Alzheimer's dementia.
Concentrations of 3 methoxy 4 hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), 5 hydroxy indoleacetic  acid (5 HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were determined in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from control subjects and patients of both presenile and senile age with histologically verified Alzheimer's dementia. CSF HVA increased with age in control but not in Alzheimer patients. HVA and 5 HIAA in the CSF of presenile Alzheimer patients was lower than that of age matched control subjects.
