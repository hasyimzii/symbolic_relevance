Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and hyperprolactinemia as manifestations of parasellar  meningioma.
We describe two women with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and cranial nerve palsy. Elevated serum prolactin levels were found in both patients before and after administration of protirelin. Both patients had an abnormal sella turcica with suprasellar mass. A prolactin secreting tumor with suprasellar extension was considered, but further investigation and surgical exploration showed that both patients had parasellar meningiomas. These findings indicate that parasellar meningioma can produce hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of women with galactorrhea and amenorrhea.
