Early gastric cancer was found in 4 and penetrating gastric cancer in 3 out of 285 patients who had undergone gastroscopy and histologic evaluation of biopsy specimens because of chronic recurrent uncharacteristic gastric complaints. The detection rate for early cancer thus was 1.4%. Selection of patients based on clinical criteria will raise the detection rate to 2.7%.
