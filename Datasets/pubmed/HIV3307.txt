Development of disease and virus recovery in transgenic mice containing HIV proviral DNA.
Transgenic mice containing intact copies of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proviral DNA were constructed. Founder animals were not viremic for HIV and remained healthy during a 9 month observation period. After being mated with nontransgenic animals, one founder mouse (No. 13) gave rise to F1 progeny that developed a disease syndrome characterized by marked epidermal hyperplasia, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, pulmonary lymphoid infiltrates, growth retardation, and death by day 25 of life. Infectious HIV, indistinguishable from parental virus by immunoblot analysis, was recovered from the spleen, lymph nodes, and skin of five of five affected animals.
