Diabetic oculomotor paresis with pupil fixed to light.
The pupillary near response should always be evaluated when the light response is defective. We present a case of diabetic third nerve paresis with concomitant light near dissociation. Without careful evaluation of the near response, angiography would have been indicated to rule out a posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Pharmacologic and slit lamp testing can be used to verify light near dissociation.
