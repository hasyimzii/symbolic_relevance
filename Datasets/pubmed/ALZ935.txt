Reduced number of 3Hnicotine and 3Hacetylcholine binding sites in the frontal cortex of Alzheimer brains.
Nicotinic cholinergic receptors were measured in human frontal cortex using [3H]nicotine and [3H]acetylcholine (in the presence of atropine) as receptor ligands. A parallel marked reduction in number of [3H]nicotine (52%; P less than 0.01) and [3H]acetylcholine ( 55%; P less than 0.05) binding was found in the frontal cortex of Alzheimer brains (AD/SDAT) when compared to age matched control brains. As a comparison the number of muscarinic receptors was quantified using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate and found to be significantly increased (+23%; less than 0.01) in AD/SDAT compared to controls.
