Hemophilia and acquired immunodeficiency.
French hemophiliacs have been infected with HIV between 1980 and 1985 initially by american Factor VIII concentrates and later by french Factor VIII and IX concentrates. Viral inactivation methods applied to these plasma derivatives appear to have interrupted infection the rate of which is currently about 50 p. 100. An increasing number of these individuals develop clinical complications related to immunodeficiency and AIDS. Biological tests are available to indicate the intensity of viral replication causing clinical symptoms, and these could be used to initiate an early anti viral therapy. A major educational effort should be undertaken to limit the HIV infection spread among female sex partners of hemophiliacs.
