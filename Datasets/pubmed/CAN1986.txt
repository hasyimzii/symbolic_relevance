Cushing's syndrome due to an ACTH secreting adrenal medullary tumour.
A 35 year old man with Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH production is described. The six week history and severe proximal myopathy were highly suggestive of a malignant tumour, but a solitary phaeochromocytoma of the left adrenal gland was the source of ACTH production. The surgical outcome was successful and three months post operatively the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis was normal. At 12 months follow up he remains well with complete regression of the features of Cushing's syndrome.
