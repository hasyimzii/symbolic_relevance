Long term treatment of circulatory disturbances of the retina and optic (author's transl).
Forty six patients with in most cases severe vascular degenerative retinochoroidal circulatory disturbances or with glaucomatous visual field defects were treated with rokan dragees (160 mg/day for four weeks, then 120 mg/day). The following were checked at monthly intervals to determine the degree of success of the treatment: visual acuity, visual field, funduscopy, pulse rate and blood pressure, sometimes including intraocular pressure, fluorescence angiography and ODG. The results of the treatment are reported and discussed with regard to the largely bad prognosis of these serious disorders.
