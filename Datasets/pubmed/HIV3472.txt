Systemic glutathione deficiency in symptom free HIV seropositive individuals.
To find out whether systemic glutathione deficiency is associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, thus contributing to the immunodeficiency state, glutathione concentrations in venous plasma and lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of symptom free HIV seropositive and normal individuals were measured. Total and reduced glutathione concentrations in the plasma of the HIV infected subjects were about 30% of those in the normal individuals. Concentrations of these substances in the ELF of HIV infected subjects were about 60% of those in the controls. There was no correlation between ELF and plasma concentrations of total or reduced glutathione. Since glutathione enhances immune function, glutathione deficiency may contribute to the progressive immune dysfunction of HIV infection.
