Radiotherapy for carcinoma of the nasal cavity.
Twenty five patients with primary epithelial carcinoma of the nasal cavity without nodal or distant metastases were treated by irradiation between 1967 and 1978. Small field, beam directed techniques delivered 6,000 to 7,000 rads with conventional fractionation. Control of the primary tumor was achieved in 21 (84%) patients after irradiation. All five treatment failures (one infield only, three infield recurrence with lymph node metastases, and one regional cervical node metastasis) were evident within six months; all five patients died of cancer. The adjusted actuarial survival rate at three years was 76%. Failure in the untreated neck was only 5% when the primary carcinoma was controlled and 16% overall. The literature has been reviewed with attention to tumor control rates and survival.
