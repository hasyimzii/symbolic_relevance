Changing to U100 insulins.
The change of insulin strength to 100 units/mL is underway, and patients should be changed now. Make sure the syringe is changed at the same time. Only in those patients having a dose greater than 100 units will the syringe (ordinary medical 2.0 mL syringe) be the same, but the volume is different. Further information and help may be obtained from the insulin manufacturers, hospital diabetic clinics, State offices of the Diabetes Federation of Australia, or the Hot Line Service.
