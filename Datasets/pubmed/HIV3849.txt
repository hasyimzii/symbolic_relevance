Lipophilic halogenated congeners of 2',3' dideoxypurine nucleosides active against human immunodeficiency virus in vitro.
Four 2 amino 6 halo  and four 6 halo 2',3' dideoxypurine ribofuranosides (ddPs) were synthesized and tested for in vitro activity to suppress the infectivity, cytopathic effect, Gag protein expression, and DNA synthesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The comparative order of in vitro anti HIV activity of the eight 6 halo ddPs was as follows: 2 amino 6 fluoro, 2 amino 6 chloro, 6 fluoro greater than 2 amino 6 bromo greater than 2 amino 6 iodo, 6 chloro greater than 6 bromo greater than 6 iodo. 2 Amino 6 fluoro , 2 amino 6 chloro , and 6 fluoro ddPs showed a potent activity against HIV comparable to that of 2',3' dideoxyinosine (ddI) or 2',3' dideoxyguanosine (ddG) and completely blocked the infectivity of HIV without affecting the growth of target cells. The lipophilicity order was as follows: 2 amino 6 iodo greater than 2 amino 6 bromo greater than 2 amino 6 chloro greater than 2 amino 6 fluoro much greater than ddG greater than ddI. All eight 6 halo ddPs were substrates for adenosine deaminase (ADA; adenosine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.4). The relative rates of hydrolysis by ADA were as follows: ddA, 2 amino 6 fluoro much greater than 2 amino 6 chloro, 2 amino 6 bromo greater than 2 amino 6 iodo. Taken together, these compounds may represent an additional class of lipophilic prodrugs for ddI and ddG and may also provide a strategy for endowing therapeutic purine nucleosides with desirable lipophilicity.
