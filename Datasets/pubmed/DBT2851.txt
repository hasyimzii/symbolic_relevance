Effects of age on various aspects of glucose and insulin metabolism.
Age is known to be associated with the development of glucose intolerance. In this review an effort has been made to differentiate between the effects of age per se on glucose tolerance, as distinguished from those of such age related variables as obesity, diet, development of frank diabetes, etc. At the same time, an attempt was made to evaluate the evidence implicating abnormalities of insulin secretion and/or insulin action in the development of glucose intolerance with age. It is concluded that the questions being asked are far from simple, and that available data do not provide unequivocal answers.
