Glycosylated hemoglobin A2 components.
Partially purified hemoglobin A2 has been examined for the existence of glycosylated components by isoelectric focusing and by acid agar gel electrophoresis. Bands analogous to the glycohemoglobin derivatives of hemoglobin A, hemoglobin A1.a.b.c, were readily detected. Evidence that these minor bands are in fact glycohemoglobins was obtained by showing that 14C glucose bound to hemoglobin A2 moved with these minor bands. The amounts of glycohemoglobin derivatives of hemoglobin A2 were increased in the blood of diabetic patients.
