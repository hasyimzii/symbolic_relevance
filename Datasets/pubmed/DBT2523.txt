Increased integrated concentration of norepinephrine, epinephrine, aldosterone, and growth hormone in patients with uncontrolled juvenile diabetes mellitus.
The 24 h integrated plasma concentration of glucose (IC glucose), norepinephrine  (IC NE), epinephrine (IC E), cortisol (IC F), growth hormone (IC GH), aldosterone (IC ALDO), and plasma renin activity (IC PRA) were measured in 11 nonobese juvenile onset nonketotic diabetic patients exhibiting hyperglycemia and glycosuria and 34 matched control subjects using a portable pump, drawing blood at a constant rate through a nonthrombogenic i.v. catheter. The diabetic patients had a noticeable rise of their IC NE, IC E, IC GH, and IC ALDO. There was no significant difference between the IC F and IC PRA of the patients and the control subjects.
