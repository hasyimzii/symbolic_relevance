Functional analysis of CAR, the target sequence for the Rev protein of HIV 1.
Expression of high levels of the structural proteins of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) requires the presence of the protein encoded by the rev open reading frame (Rev) and its associated target sequence CAR (cis anti repression sequence) which is present in the env region of viral RNA. Extensive mutagenesis demonstrated that CAR has a complex secondary structure consisting of a central stem and five stem/loops. Disruption of any of these structures severely impaired the Rev response, but many of the stem/loops contain material that was unnecessary for Rev regulation and must be retained in these structures to avoid disturbing adjacent structures critical for CAR function. Probably no more than two of the described structural components are involved in sequence specific recognition by regulatory proteins.
