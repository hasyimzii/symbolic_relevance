Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 rev protein as a negative trans regulator.
Even though the rev gene of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) is essential for viral replication, high levels of rev also downregulate viral gene expression. As the degree of rev protein expression exceeds expression of wild type virus, a gradient of decreasing viral mRNA synthesis becomes evident. The target sequence for this downregulation resides outside of trans activating region (TAR) and upstream from the enhancer sequences in the long terminal repeat (LTR), suggesting that regulation is at a transcriptional level.
