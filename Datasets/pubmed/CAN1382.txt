Reactive pseudosarcomatous response in urinary bladder.
An unusual pseudosarcomatous lesion of the urinary bladder is described in a thirty two year old woman. The absence of malignant epithelial elements, the benign clinical course, and a history of chronic cystitis support the interpretation of a reactive proliferation. Awareness of this entity is important in determining therapeutic intervention.
