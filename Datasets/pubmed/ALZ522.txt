Phases of change in the patient with Alzheimer's dementia: a conceptual dimension for defining health care management.
Since the progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders of later life gradually imposes a series of significant limitations upon the patient, a successful clinical management program rests upon a conceptualization of changes in the patient. Postulating psychologic reactions helps professionals to understand and respond to the patient's needs and feelings at different stages of the disease. The phases discussed here provide the basis for defining treatment goals and management plans, selecting therapeutic strategies, identifying needed resources, and evolving innovative approaches to patient care.
