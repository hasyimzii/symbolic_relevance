Declining rates of amebiasis in Los Angeles County: a sentinel for decreasing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) incidence?
In Los Angeles County from 1983 1988, rates of amebiasis declined 65 percent among White males 15 44 years. No such decline occurred among White females 15 44 years or White males less than 15. Reported acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases in the district of highest AIDS incidence has followed the initial decline in amebiasis by four years. Amebiasis trends may be a useful predictor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and future rates of AIDS among gay men.
