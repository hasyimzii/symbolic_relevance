Characterization of the responding populations for the generation of proliferative response to syngeneic Meth A tumor in BALB/c mice: requirement of T and B cell collaboration.
High levels of primary proliferative response to a chemically induced sarcoma Meth A can be induced in syngeneic BALB/c spleen cells. Testing at the peak of proliferative response (2 days after sensitization in the mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture), we found the responders to be resistant to anti Thy 1.2 antibody lysis but susceptible to anti Ia antibody lysis. When responders were subjected to various treatments before sensitization, it was found that removal of macrophages had no effect on the generation of proliferative response; high levels of proliferative response could be induced in enriched B cell preparations and in spleen cells from nude mice, but there was only a negligible amount of response in enriched T cell preparations. These findings indicate that the responders are primarily B lymphocytes. However, it was also found that the enriched B cell preparations usually gave only 50 to 75% of the response of whole spleen cells, whereas these B cells gave a 2  to 3 fold increase in the response to a B cell mitogen, LPS; this result indicate that collaboration from other types of lymphocytes was required for the generation of an optimal proliferative response to Meth A. Addition of 10% of T cells indeed produced a helper effect on this B cell response, and the maximal helper effect was seen for a mixture containing equal parts of T cells and B cells or for a slight T cell excess. These results indicate that the proliferative response to a syngeneic Meth A tumor is a macrophage independent T dependent B cell response.
