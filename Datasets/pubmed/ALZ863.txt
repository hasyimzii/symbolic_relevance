Haptoglobin groups in dementia of Alzheimer type and multi infarct dementia.
Haptoglobin (Hp) groups were determined in 65 patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) and 74 with multi infarct dementia (MID). The increased Hp1 gene frequency among patients with DAT described by other investigators could not be confirmed in this study. The patients showed no significant difference from the controls with respect to phenotype and gene frequencies, and there were no significant differences between early and late onset cases of DAT.
