Insulin receptor interaction of plasma membranes of liver cells and isolated adipocytes of the rat with different insulin content in the blood.
Study on the insulin  receptor interaction of the plasma membranes of liver cells demonstrated a reverse dependence of insulin concentration in the blood and the number of insulin binding sites on the membranes. Using isolated adipocytes, it was shown that at a constant number of receptors the receptor density is changed. These changes are correlated with the decrease of biological effects in experimental obesity accompanied by hyperinsulinism. In the case of streptosotocin diabetes (simulated hypoinsulinism) no correlation between insulin binding and its biological effects was observed, which can be accounted for by disturbances in transmission of the signal from the insulin  receptor complex to the enzymatic systems of the cells.
