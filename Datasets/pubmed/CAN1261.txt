Inhibition of calcium and glucose uptake by murine leukemia L5178Y cells treated  with antiserum.
Studies were performed to determine whether decreases in transport of calcium and glucose might be among the earliest changes triggered by the antigen antibody reactions occurring on the cell surface of murine leukemia L5178Y cells after treatment with rabbit antisera. After treatment with antisera, in the absence of complement, these cells exhibited a decreased uptake of 45Ca, 2 deoxy[3H]glucose, and 3 0 methyl[3H]glucose. These changes occurred rapidly, within 2 minutes after the addition of antiserum, in contrast to the previously reported inhibitory effects of antiserum on DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which became demonstrable only after 4 to 8 hours. The kinetics of uptake of the radioactive substrates was biphasic, with a very rapid initial uptake followed by less rapid linear uptake. The precise mechanism of cell growth inhibition remains to be elucidated, but one of the initial effects of antiserum treatment may be a perturbation at the cell membrane such that transport of specific nutrients is decreased, resulting in the observed effects on macromolecular synthesis.
