Nutritional aspects of ascorbic acid: uses and abuses.
Ascorbic acid in physiological doses is essential for the normal functioning of the human body. Larger doses are required to treat a severe deficiency of vitamin C intake, as in the case of scurvy. Occasionally, massive doses may be required to treat a metabolic defect involving ascorbic acid. There has been some mention of megadose therapy with ascorbic acid for the prevention of colds, the improved healing of wounds and even the treatment of cancer, but no acceptable scientific data have been presented. In fact, in a few instances, such therapy has proved injurious.
