The evaluation of autofluorescence emission spectra derived from neuronal lipopigment.
A method for measuring the emission spectra from regions of neuronal lipopigment  in tissue sections is described and illustrated. Each emission spectrum was derived from the means of six sets of readings, from either six regions of lipopigment from six neurones which were presumed to be from a homogeneous cell population, or from one region of one neurone. Characteristics of the emission spectra from lipopigment in various forms of neuronal ceroid lipofusinoses (NCLs) and in brains without evidence of NCL are presented and discussed. The results indicate that the classification of lipopigments should not be restricted to the two categories of 'lipofuscin' and 'ceroid'. This method may aid the identification of various pathogenic mechanisms in neurones, and provide another means of investigating the effects of certain drugs on cerebral function.
