Clostridium septicum infection associated with colonic carcinoma and hematologic  abnormality.
Six patients with Clostridium septicum sepsis seen at Duke University Medical Center over a two year period also had other abnormalities, consisting of hematologic disorders in 3 and colon tumors in 3. Three patients died of sepsis; 2 survived following disarticulation of the arm to control gas gangrene, while the sixth patient survived the sepsis but died of metastatic disease. When anaerobic cultures are positive for C. septicum, antibiotics should be given immediately. The high incidence of underlying colon tumor, especially in the cecum, should prompt consideration of a barium enema examination.
