Definition of T cell specific DNA binding factors that interact with a 3' silencer in the CD4+ T cell gene Rpt 1.
Analysis of the region 3' to the CD4+ T cell gene Rpt 1 (encoding regulatory protein T lymphocyte 1) led to the definition of a silencer element that inhibits heterologous gene expression in certain CD4+ T cell lines but not in B cell or non lymphoid cell lines. Functional silencer activity in vivo was associated with the presence of a specific silencer DNA protein complex in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with T cell extracts. Formation of this complex was selectively inhibited by the region in HIV 1 containing a silencer element. We discuss the possibility that DNA binding factors may coregulate HIV 1 and Rpt 1 gene expression through a common transcriptional silencer element.
