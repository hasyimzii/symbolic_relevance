Mouse immunoglobulin D: construction and characterization of a cloned delta chain cDNA.
TEPC 1017 is a BALB/c plasmacytoma that synthesizes IgD in large enough amounts to permit the isolation of mRNA for mouse delta chains. cDNA has been prepared from this mRNA, and an 880 base pair fragment of it has been cloned by recombinant DNA techniques. The hybridization selection technique has been used to show that this cDNA clone specifically binds only mRNA that can be translated into immunoprecipitable delta chains. the sequence of a portion of this clone has been determined and, when translated, shows homology with the C delta 3 of a human myeloma protein. Using this cDNA clone as a probe, we have found that several different sized delta RNAs are present in TEPC 1017 and in another IgD secreting plasmacytoma, TEPC 1033.
