Peripheral neuroepithelioma: a light and electron microscopic study.
A primitive neuroectodermal tumor of peripheral nerve origin was examined by light and electron microscopy. The lesion arose in association with the S1 nerve root of the lumbosacral plexus in a 22 year old female. Following a surgical biopsy, the patient received systemic chemotherapy; however, approximately one and a half years later, she suffered a clinical relapse with locally recurrent tumor. An excisional biopsy was performed, and pathologic examination revealed progressive neuroblastic differentiation. The ultrastructural features of neoplastic Homer Wright rosettes will be illustrated, and the non specificity of cytoplasmic glycogen in the evaluation of "small round cell neoplasms" will be emphasized.
