Compartmental body composition based on total body nitrogen, potassium, and calcium.
The techniques of prompt gamma neutron activation analysis for the measurement of total body nitrogen and whole body counting for the measurement of total body potassium were used to determine the mass of muscle and nonmuscle lean tissue and their protein content in 135 normal male and female subjects, 20 80 yr of age. Age related changes in the size of the muscle and nonmuscle compartments and their protein content provide basic data for the investigation of protein metabolism in aging subjects and in individuals with various metabolic disorders, particularly wasting diseases such as cancer. Significant age related changes in the size of various body compartments were noted. The loss of muscle mass and its protein content contrasts with the relative constancy of the nonmuscle lean tissue and suggests that skeletal muscle is particularly vulnerable to the aging process.
