Histology of small melanomas.
In a series of 193 choroidal melanomas we collected the histological data of 25 small and 31 medium sized tumours enucleated on the basis of the results of the 32P test. Thirty four (34%) percent showed epitheloid cells and 70% showed scleral involvement, both percentages being higher than in most reports. We do not advocate observation and delay of treatment in case of small melanomas until growth is established clinically.
