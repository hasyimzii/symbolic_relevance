Living with dementia: the ongoing funeral.
Dementia is an illness profoundly affecting the patient's physical and emotional  well being. The impact of the disease extends far beyond the patient himself, touching each family member involved in the patient's care. Social workers and other mental health professionals can offer valuable assistance to the family as they experience each stage of the patient's illness. Several theoretical constructs aid in understanding the grieving process of the family. Clinical case examples are used to highlight individual and group therapeutic interventions.
