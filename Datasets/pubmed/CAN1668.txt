1,3 Bis(2 chloroethyl) 1 nitrosourea (BCNU) induced pulmonary fibrosis.
Clinical data are presented on 14 patients undergoing BCNU therapy for a primary  intracranial glioma (11 biopsied, 3 suspected) in whom pulmonary fibrosis developed as a consequence of the therapy. Pulmonary diffusion abnormalities, dry hacking cough, and chest x ray changes herald the onset of the process. Microscopic evaluation of lung specimens revealed a wide spectrum of change including hyaline membrane formation, alveolar septal thickening, interstitial fibrosis, and granuloma formation. It is concluded that BCNU causes pulmonary fibrosis that is primarily but not necessarily dose related and may not be reversible.
