Self assembly of microtubule associated protein tau into filaments resembling those found in Alzheimer disease.
Microtubule associated protein tau factor self assembles into filamentous structures resembling the paired helical filaments found in Alzheimer disease. Tau polymerization requires of a previous modification; conversion of glutamine into glutamic acid by deamination.
