Anti HTLV III testing  a practical solution for blood transfusion services?
Screening blood donations for anti HTLV III with a modification to a commercially available test kit has so far been found satisfactory  the reagent cost is less than R1.00 a donation. Should all transfusion services adopt this method, South Africa's total blood donations could be tested at a cost of about R650 000, instead of R2.7 million or more, a year.
