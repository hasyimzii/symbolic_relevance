Extrathoracic esophagectomy in the treatment of esophageal cancer.
Extrathoracic esophagectomy has the potential of improving the results of resectional therapy for carcinoma of the esophagus by eliminating the need for thoracotomy and decreasing postoperative pulmonary complications. This report compares the operative and functional results of blunt extrathoracic esophagectomy and substernal reversed gastric tube reconstruction in patients with esophageal cancer to results in 10 consecutive nonrandomized control patients treated by standard esophagogastrectomy. Extrathoracic esophagectomy was associated with greater pulmonary dysfunction than standard esophagogastrectomy. While there was no significant difference in survival in the two groups, three patients in the standard esophagogastrectomy group (mean survival 9.0 months) and none in the extrathoracic esophagectomy group (mean survival 7.4 months) developed anastomotic recurrence. Extrathoracic esophagectomy evidently does not afford patients with esophageal carcinoma better palliation than standard esophagogastrectomy.
