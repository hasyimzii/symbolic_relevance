AIDS/HIV: risk for surgeons  new surgical routines.
The surgical team is at risk of transmission of human immunodefiency virus (HIV)  from the patient, which could progress to AIDS and death. In our hospital, we have estimated a probability of 0.20% per year, and 5.82% for 30 years in surgery. In view of this we have designed new procedures for surgical handicraft to reduce the risk from splash or injury to the surgical team. The surgeon must handle tissue with instruments only and minimize the use of fingers. Sharp instruments should, if possible be replaced by blunt types. The nurse loads needles to the needle carrier using a forceps. Sharp instruments are placed in a neutral zone on the nurse's stand so that the surgeon and nurse never touch the same sharp instrument at the same time. Movements must be controlled and accompanied by eye contact. The measures to prevent injury would hardly affect the individual skill of the surgeon or prolong operation time. We consider that the new routines suggested prevent transmission of HIV during surgical procedures better than by knowing the HIV status, of the patients.
