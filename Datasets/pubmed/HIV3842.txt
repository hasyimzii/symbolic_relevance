Computed tomography and lateral ventricular asymmetry: clinical and brain structural correlates.
Asymmetry of the ventricles of the brain without an obvious cause is a common and intriguing radiologic finding. To understand this phenomenon better the authors conducted a 24 month study to compare clinical and structural manifestations of two groups of patients who had undergone head computed tomography (CT): group A comprised 249 patients with asymmetry of the lateral ventricles of the brain without space occupying lesions, intracranial bleeding, recent infarction or trauma and group B comprised 266 patients with the above exclusion criteria but without ventricular asymmetry. The degree of ventricular asymmetry was classified as mild, moderate or severe, according to the ratio of the larger frontal horn diameter to the smaller one. The incidence of lateral ventricular asymmetry was 5.3%. The following clinical manifestations were more frequently present in group A: headaches (p = 0.002), seizures (p = 0.007) and positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status (p = 0.02). Transient ischemic attacks were more prevalent in group B (p = 0.009). Independent predictors of headache were: younger age (p less than 0.001) and the degree of ventricular asymmetry (p = 0.02). Predictors of seizures were: younger age (p less than 0.001), ventricular asymmetry (p = 0.004) and the absence of septal deviation (p = 0.009). In group A, predictors of a higher degree of asymmetry were septal deviation (p less than 0.001) and older age (p = 0.008). The authors conclude that asymmetry of the lateral ventricles of the brain is a relatively common CT finding that has important clinical and brain structural correlates and deserves more attention in the field of imaging.
