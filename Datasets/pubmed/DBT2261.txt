Candida infections in geriatrics a current problem (author's transl).
Investigations for candidiasis of the skin and mucous membranes were done in 191  probands over 65 years of age, of whon 187 were occupants of an old people's home and 4 were having in patient treatment. In the homes being tested Candida infections of the skin and mucous membranes were very numerous (48% and 26% of those investigated) comparable with the epidemics of thrush in premature and newborn units in previous years. Even the localisation of candidiasis was remarkably similar to that in the newborn and infant age groups (Candida mycosis of the external ear and intercrural area, generalised skin candidiasis resembling Leiner's desquamating erythrodermia). The cause of cutaneous candidiasis in old age was in most cases faecal incontinence in chronically bedridden obese patients (intestinal colonisation with C. albicans). Diabetes mellitus, on the other hand, seems to play only a secondary role in the conditions of old people's homes.
