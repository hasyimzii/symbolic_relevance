Axoplasmic transport in vagal afferent fibres in normal and alloxan diabetic rabbits.
Fast and slow components of anterograde axoplasmic transport have been studied in the sensory fibres of the vagus nerve of alloxan diabetic rabbits and age matched controls by incorporation of tritiated leucine into nodose ganglion cells. The diabetic rabbits were maintained for 2 months with blood glucose levels in the range 20  40 mmol/l. They showed growth retardation and one third developed cataracts. No alteration of either fast or slow axoplasmic transport was detected in the diabetic animals. These results are discussed in the light of the present understanding of the role of axoplasmic transport, of the findings in other axoplasmic transport studies, and of other data available on the pathogenesis of human and experimental diabetic neuropathy.
