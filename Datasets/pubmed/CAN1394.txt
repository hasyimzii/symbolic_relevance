Physiological effects of hyperthermia: response of capillary blood flow and structure to local tumor heating.
Specific capillary blood flow and small vessel pathology in animal tumors (rhabdomyosarcoma BA 1112) of WAG/Rij rats were examined following local tumor heating to 40 44.5 degrees C. Blood flow in tumors heated to 40 41 degrees C for 40 minutes was reduced initially by about 50%, but returned to near preheating values within 72 hours, consistent with the histopathological observations indicating small vessel dilation and temporary congestion. The application of hyperthermia greater than 43 degrees C (for 40 minutes) resulted in the virtual elimination of capillary blood flow, consistent with pathological findings of widespread vessel rupture and hemorrhage in this temperature range.
