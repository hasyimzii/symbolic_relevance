Possible antagonists to gastrin in parathyroid adenomas.
The high incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers in patients with hyperparathyroidism  has been ascribed to gastric hyperacidity induced by hypercalcaemia. In a clinical study comprising 40 patients with solitary parathyroid adenoma, a negative correlation between serum calcium and spontaneous gastric acid secretion was found. At the same time a positive correlation was found between serum calcium and gastrin. It is concluded that gastric hyperacidity is not part of the syndrome provoked by parathyroid adenomas, and that a mechanism inhibitory to gastrin is active in these patients. It is suggested that the inhibitor could be calcitonin.
