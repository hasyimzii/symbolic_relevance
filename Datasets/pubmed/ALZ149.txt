Dietary aluminum and Alzheimer's disease  a review.
Current evidence suggests that dietary aluminum is neither an essential nutrient  nor a toxic element causing neurological damage. The phosphate and fluoride salts of aluminum are very insoluble. When fed in excess, aluminum increases the dietary needs for these anions. Aluminum hydroxide is used as an antacid that can prevent the phosphatemia seen in severe kidney damage. In Alzheimer's disease there is progressive decrease in brain mass with the accumulation of phospholipid rich cell debris. These membrane tangles tend to accumulate aluminum and are easily stainable with silver.
