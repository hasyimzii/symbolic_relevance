Pharmacologic management of Alzheimer type dementia.
Diagnosis of Alzheimer type dementia is made by excluding other causes of dementia. This type of dementia is not well understood, but affects one million persons in the United States. Ergoloid mesylates are sometimes useful. A promising approach may be increasing brain cholinergic activity through combinations of drugs, such as lecithin and physostigmine. Sleep disturbances and impulsivity may both respond to benzodiazepines. Other drugs are being studied, but nonpharmacologic strategies may accomplish more.
