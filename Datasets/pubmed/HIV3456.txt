Antenatal testing for human immunodeficiency virus. Results from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' National Study of HIV Infection in Pregnancy.
Current policies on antenatal testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the main obstetric units of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland were surveyed by postal questionnaire; 294 of 299 units responded. HIV testing was available at 192 (65%) of the 294 units that responded. 414 HIV positive pregnancies in 386 women were reported from 74 (25%) units. Most were from Scotland, the four Thames Regions, and Ireland. In 46% of the HIV positive women the infection was identified by antenatal testing; the remainder had been tested previously and knew that they were infected. The findings support the view that selective antenatal testing should be established in areas where no testing is offered at present and possibly that testing should be offered to all pregnant women in high prevalence areas.
