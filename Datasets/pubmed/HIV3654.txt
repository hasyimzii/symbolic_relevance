Affinity purification of the HIV 1 protease.
An inhibitor of the HIV 1 protease has been employed in the generation of a resin which allows the rapid purification of this enzyme. A peptide substrate analogue, H2N Ser Gln Asn (Phe psi[CH2N] Pro) Ile Val Gln OH, was coupled to agarose resin. The HIV 1 protease was expressed in E. coli and the supernatant from lysed cells was passed through the affinity resin. Active HIV 1 protease was then eluted with a buffer change to pH 10 and 2 M NaCl. Final purification to a homogeneous preparation, capable of crystallization, was achieved with hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Solutions containing HIV 1 protease bound to competitive inhibitors do not bind to the column.
