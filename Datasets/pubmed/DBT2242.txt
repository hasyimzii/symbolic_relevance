Stimulation of residual insulin secretion by glibenclamide in insulin dependent diabetics.
Residual insulin secretion, reflected by the presence of C peptide in serum and urine, has been demonstrated in 5 of 10 insulin requiring diabetics of less than 10 years' duration tested. The C peptide response, in the C peptide secretors, showed a significant increase in both serum and urine after 4 weeks' treatment with 15 mg glibenclamide daily in addition to their usual insulin regime although no beneficial effects in metabolic control were detected. It is suggested that glibenclamide might be a useful adjunct to insulin therapy in insulin requiring diabetics who still secrete C peptide.
