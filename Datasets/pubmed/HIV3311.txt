Autonomous functional domains of chemically synthesized human immunodeficiency virus tat trans activator protein.
HIV 1 encodes a potent trans activator protein, tat, which is essential for viral gene expression. To study tat domains that function in trans activation, we chemically synthesized the 86 amino acid tat protein (tat 86) and tat mutant peptides. Remarkably, tat 86 is rapidly taken up by cells, and produces a massive and specific stimulation of HIV LTR driven RNA synthesis. Mutant peptides of 21 to 41 amino acids exhibit significant activity. Only two regions are essential for trans activation; we suggest that one represents an activation region and the other, a nucleic acid binding or nuclear targeting region. Amino acid substitutions within these regions greatly reduce trans activation, demonstrating the functional significance of these domains. The N terminal 37 amino acids and exon 2 are not essential. Thus, tat is similar to regulatory proteins of Ad E1A and BPV1 E5 oncogenes, requiring only small domains for autonomous function.
