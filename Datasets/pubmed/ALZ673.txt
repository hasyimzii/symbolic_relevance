The effect of ACTH4 9 analog (Org2766) on some cerebrospinal fluid parameters in  patients with Alzheimer's disease.
In a double blind, placebo controlled study, the central nervous system effects of an ACTH4 9 analog, Org2766 (40 mg/day), in Alzheimer's disease were assessed by measuring cerebrospinal fluid parameters during 6 months' treatment. Somatostatin like immunoreactivity and cholinesterase activity, which are known to be reduced in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer patients compared with controls, did not change during treatment. As a marker of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems, we measured dopamine beta hydroxylase and homovanillic acid, but both levels were static. These results suggest that Org2766 did not interact with the transmitter systems, which are thought to be disturbed in Alzheimer's disease.
