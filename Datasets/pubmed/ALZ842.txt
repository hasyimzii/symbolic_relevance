Neuropsychological approach to the complex study of senile dementia.
Thirty eight patients with late mentally deteriorating processes were studied. Using a standardized neuropsychological method, the authors have outlined four major variants of neuropsychological syndromes characteristic of damage to definite zones of the brain. Comparison of these data with the results of clinical and computer aided tomographic examination showed that the neuropsychological approach is an adequate method in the combined study of senile dementia.
