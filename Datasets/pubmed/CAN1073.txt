Estrogen receptor status and response to chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer.
Tumor estrogen receptor status in women with advanced breast cancer was correlated with clinical response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in a retrospective study. Following an extramural review of the clinical data of 40 patients, 26 responded to chemotherapy (65%). The response rate in 19 receptor rich tumors was 89% and in 21 receptor poor tumors, 43% (P < 0.01). The lowest response rate (14%) was observed in seven postmenopausal patients with receptor poor tumors. Clinical characteristics of patients and variants in chemotherapy programs failed to explain the favorable response of receptor rich tumors to cytotoxic chemotherapy.
