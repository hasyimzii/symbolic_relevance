3HKainic acid binding and choline acetyltransferase activity in Alzheimer's dementia.
The binding of [3H]kainic acid to caudate nucleus membranes prepared from brains  of examples of Alzheimer's dementia and controls has been determined. No changes were detected in either the affinity or the number of kainate binding sites in the Alzheimer samples compared to control, although there was a large decrease in choline acetyltransferase activity.
