Pharmacokinetics of zidovudine (AZT) and its metabolite (G AZT) in healthy subjects and in patients with kidney failure.
Pharmacokinetics of zidovudine was investigated after oral administration (200 mg) in 25 HIV seronegative subjects: 14 patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 6 to 31 ml/min), 5 hemodialyzed anuric patients, and 6 healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, G. AZT concentrations are higher than those of AZT; AUC were 23.7 +/  1.9 and 5.2 +/  0.6 mumol.h/l respectively. Formation of G. AZT rate limits its elimination: G. AZT half life parallels that of AZT which is around 1 hour. In uremic patients AZT concentrations are moderately increased (AUC = 11.7 +/  1.1 mumol.h/l), whereas half life and MRT remains unchanged, despite the decreased renal clearance (16 +/  2 vs 220 +/  58 ml/min). In contrast G. AZT concentrations are markedly increased (AUC = 403 +/  89 mumol.h/l). As a consequence of the decreased renal clearance (27 +/  3 vs 331 +/  42 ml/min), elimination is the rate limiting step and half life is increased (8 +/  2 vs 0.9 +/  0.1 h). Contribution of a 4 hour hemodialysis session to AZT elimination appears negligible whereas elimination of G. AZT is enhanced.
