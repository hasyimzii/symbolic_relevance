Physiologic analysis of the myoclonus of Alzheimer's disease.
Ten patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, including three cases of trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome), developed a chronic myoclonic disorder. The technique of jerk locked averaging of EEG activity was used to analyze the myoclonus. Seven subjects demonstrated a focal, contralateral central, negative cerebral potential antecedent to the myoclonic jerks. This EEG event differs from that previously reported to be associated with the myoclonus of subacute spongiform encephalopathy (Creutzfeldt Jakob disease).
