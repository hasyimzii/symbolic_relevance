Death caused by drug addiction: a review of the experiences in Hamburg and the situation in the Federal Republic of Germany in comparison with the literature.
Based on criminological experiences and pathomorphological, serological and toxicological studies of more than 300 fatalities, an overview is given of drugs, their intravenous abuse and drug deaths in Hamburg and the Federal Republic of Germany. The number of drug deaths has increased dramatically in Hamburg, where there were more than 50 cases each year in 1987 and 1988. In the F.R.G. approximately 400 cases are registered per annum. The percentage of female intravenous drug abusers is growing and the age of the decedents is increasing. The mean was formerly 25 years, but is now 30 years. Among the histopathological findings, foreign body granulomas are of special value; infectious diseases, especially hepatitis B and HIV infection, have to be investigated serologically and morphologically. The prevalence of HIV 1 antibodies among drug deaths in Hamburg is approximately 15%, in comparison with approximately 50% in Berlin. The "supply" of heroin has apparently become so copious that nearly all deaths are caused by overdosage with this substance. An international agreement about a definition of a drug death is a prerequisite for nationwide analyses.
