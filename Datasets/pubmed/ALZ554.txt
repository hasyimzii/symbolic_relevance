Diagnosis and course of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (clinico pathologoanatomic parallels.
Long term observations of five patients aged 40 to 70 years made it possible to diagnose Creutzfeld Jacob's disease (CJD) in their life time. In three cases, the diagnosis of CJD was confirmed at autopsy; one patient died at home. The works of I. Kreutzfeld and A. Jacob and the authors' observations confirm that the disease lasts 4 5 years or more. Marked manifestations of the disease were observed for two years. Some differential diagnostic criteria are presented permitting the differentiation of CJD from other atrophic processes described by Alzheimer, Pick and others.
