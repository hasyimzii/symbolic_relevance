Detection of antibody to LAV/HTLV III in sera from hemophiliacs in China.
Using ELISA, Western blots and immunofluorescence techniques, we identified seropositivity for lymphadenopathy associated virus/human lymphotropic virus III (LAV/HTLV III) in 4 of 18 hemophiliacs and 1 AIDS patient. The four seropositive patients had received factor VIII prepared by Armour Company. The hemophiliacs are all asymptomatic. Given this documentation of introduction of LAV/HTLV III into China, a national surveillance program is underway.
