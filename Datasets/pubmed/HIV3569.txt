Alithiasic cholecystitis and sclerosing cholangitis caused by Cryptosporidium and cytomegalovirus in a patient with HIV infection.
A 23 year old female, an ex parenteral drug abuser with HIV infection, developed  multiple pericholangitic abscesses secondary to lithiasic cholecystitis and sclerosing cholangitis by Cryptosporidium and cytomegalovirus. We emphasize the clinical clues and the diagnostic role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), as well as the contribution of the latter to surgical therapy (transendoscopic papillotomy). We also review the reported cases of biliary diseases by Cryptosporidium and/or cytomegalovirus in the literature.
