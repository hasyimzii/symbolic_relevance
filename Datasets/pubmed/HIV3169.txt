In vitro generation of an HTLV III variant by neutralizing antibody.
Transmission and culture of "parental" virus (HTLV III) from H9 cells transfected with the cloned isolate (lambda HXB 2D) in human serum possessing HTLV III neutralizing antibody selected for a "variant" that was not neutralized by the selecting serum but was neutralized by another antibody positive serum "Control" virus, selected in serum lacking neutralizing antibody, and the variant showed highly similar tryptic peptide maps of the major envelope glycoprotein, and no changes in restriction enzyme patterns of viral DNA. These findings show that HTLV III type specific neutralizing antibodies occur, can influence the propagation of variant viruses that may arise, and presumably result from minor changes in the eliciting antigen. The extent to which such type specific neutralizing antibodies influence immune surveillance against HTLV III infection in vivo, a question with relevance to future vaccination attempts, remains to be determined. Nucleotide sequencing of the control and variant envelope genes may elucidate a region important for virus neutralization and vaccine development.
