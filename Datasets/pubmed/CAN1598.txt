The so called metastasizing thyroid adenoma from the orthopaedic viewpoint (author's transl).
The so called metastasizing thyroid adenomas, which are now know as follicular thyroid carcinomas, present diagnostic problems again and again on account of their high degree of differentiation, since the primary tumour is often recognized as malignoma only after metastases have put in their appearance in other parts of the body. In this article, the authors report on a case of a follicular thyroid carcinoma which became manifest via a tumour of the size of an infant's head at the right upper part of the ilium.
