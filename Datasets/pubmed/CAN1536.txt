5 Di (2' tetrahydropyranyl)secalonic acid D as a new antibiotic derivative with anticancer activity.
A pyranyl derivative was chemically synthesized from secalonic acid D, an antibiotic obtained from culture filtrates of Penicillium oxalium, and its anticancer activity towards a highly antigenic rat bladder cancer, BC 47, implanted into inbred ACI/N rat was studied. The anticancer effect of the drug was similar to that of adriamycin. Delayed initiation of treatment, starting 5 days after the cancer implantation, was more effective than treatment starting from day 1. In addition, it was less effective in an immunodeficient host subsequently implanted with BC 47. This compound is thought to retard the cancer cell growth until the appearance of tumor immunity in the host.
