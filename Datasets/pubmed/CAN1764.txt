Augmentation of mouse natural killer cell activity by a streptococcal preparation, OK 432.
Streptococcal immunopotentiator OK 432 (NSC B116209) augmented the natural killer (NK) cell activity of peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) in inbred C57BL/6 mice given ip injections of 0.1 mg OK 432 per mouse. The cytotoxic activity of PEC increased as early as 1 day after inoculation, reached its peak on day 3, and gradually declined thereafter, YAC 1, K562, and MOLT 4 target cells were more sensitive to PEC than were EL 4 and P815 target cells. The elimination of adherent cells by a nylon wool column enriched the proportion of cytotoxic cells among PEC. Nylon wool column passed PEC were resistant to treatment with anti Thy 1.2 antibody plus complement and sensitive to anti asialo GM1 serum plus complement. Because 1:40 diluted rabbit antiserum against glycosphingolipid asialo GM1 is capable of eliminating mouse NK cell activity and is not cytotoxic to killer T cells, the above results strongly suggest that OK 432 augments the NK cell activity in mice.
