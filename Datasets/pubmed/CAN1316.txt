Thyroid carcinoma.
Differentiated thyroid carcinoma was studied with regard to mode of presentation, initial findings, treatment and survival. The classic signs, symptoms, physical and scan findings were found to be present in approximately 70% of the patients. Thirty percent of the patients had either unusual presentations or findings. Prognosis was found to be dependent on age of presentation more than any other factor. The effects of neck metastasis, extracapsular invasion and recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement on long term survival are studied in detail. patients with prior exposure to radiation were found to have more extensive disease and require more extensive surgery but ultimately had the same prognosis for 15 year cure. Treatment for distant metastatic disease by surgery, radioactive iodine and external radiation all resulted in long term survival in certain cases.
