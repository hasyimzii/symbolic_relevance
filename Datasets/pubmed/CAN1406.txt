In vitro cell transformation screening of 4 toluene diamine isomers.
2,4 , 2,5 , 2,6  and 3,4 Toluene diamine (TDA) were tested for their ability to enhance the transformation of primary hamster embryo cells (HEC) by Simian adenovirus 7 (SA7) when administered either prior to or after virus inoculation and for their ability to transform secondary HEC. 2,4 TDA was inactive when given prior to SA7, but active if given after. 2,5 TDA was active in both protocols. 2,6 TDA was marginally active if administered before virus and was the most active of the isomers when administered after virus. 3,4 TDA was the most active compound when added prior to SA7, and was also active when given after virus. All the isomers were capable of producing good dose  responses and absolute increases in the number of virus transformed foci per dish in one or both of the experimental regimens. Each isomer chemically transformed secondary HEC but good dose  responses were rare, and none of the chemicals were active in more than 50% of the 5 or 6 separate tests performed on each.
