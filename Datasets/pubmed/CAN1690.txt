Follow up study of B II stomachs: clinical, endoscopic and histologic results.
Histological investigation leads to significantly more reliable evaluation of the B 2 stump than do clinical or endoscopic examinations. This is the result of our study, in which follow up examinations in 58 patients were undertaken 25 to 30 years after B 2 resection for benign ulcer. Of these 58 patients 23 were examined endoscopically and histologically (22 patients). The histological results of interest are: early cancer, dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia.   Carcinoma of the gastric stump occurs only occasionally earlier than 15 years after resection. In order to detect more early cancers, we therefore suggest that a routine endoscopy and histological evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be undertaken 15 years after gastric resection for benign ulcer. Further follow ups depend on the result of this "staging" of the gastric mucosa.
