Induction of intestinal metaplasia in the glandular stomach of rats by X irradiation prior to oral administration of N methyl N' nitro N nitrosoguanidine.
CD/CRJ rats were subjected to localized X irradiation of the stomach and given N methyl N' nitro N nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in the drinking water. Rats given MNNG alone and non treated rats were used as controls. Upon sacrifice at 15 months after the initial MNNG administration, intestinal metaplasia was observed; the histology was of complete type and the incidence was 100% in rats treated with X rays and MNNG, whereas in rats treated with MNNG alone the intestinal metaplasia was of incomplete type and its incidence was 80%. However, the incidence of gastric cancer in rats treated with MNNG alone was 25%.
