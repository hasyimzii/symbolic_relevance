The value of Luria's Neuropsychological Investigation for the assessment of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer type dementia.
Items from Luria's Neuropsychological Investigation (LNI) were used to assess cognitive functioning in three groups: patients with Alzheimer type dementia (ATD), with alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome (KS) and control subjects of comparable age. The LNI was shown to be a sensitive assessment in that it distinguished differences within the ATD group and among the three groups. The validity and usefulness of the LNI in Alzheimer type dementia are discussed.
