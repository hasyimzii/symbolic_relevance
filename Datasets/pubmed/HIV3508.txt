Epidemiologic study of HIV serology in blood donors from 5 departments in northeastern France (1985 1989).
Between July 1985 and June 1989, the prevalence of HIV antibody was studied in 503,019 blood donations tested in 5 administrative areas ("departments") of north east France: 91 seropositive donations (donors) were detected (prevalence: 0.18%). The prevalence was 0.41% in 1985, 0.22% in 1986, 0.14% in 1987, 0.10% in 1988 and 0.11% in 1989: in each year, it was found lower than the national prevalence. 14 (15.4%) of the 91 seropositive donors were females, and the prevalences of HIV antibody in blood donations from female and male donors were 0.07% and 0.26% respectively. All seropositive donors were younger than 50 and 83 (91.2%) younger than 40. The prevalence of HIV antibody was higher in blood units at first donation (occasional donors) as compared with blood units collected from regular donors (0.60% versus 0.09%). The prevalence of HIV antibody was higher in blood donations from military donors as compared with donations from civilian donors (0.49% versus 0.07% in 1987, 1988 and 1989). Most seropositive military donors were young male recruits of the national armed forces conscription system. We believe that these recruits are subjects with risk factors which must be taken into account for the determination of national blood supply policies.
