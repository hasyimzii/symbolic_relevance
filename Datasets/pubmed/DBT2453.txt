Free, total and antibody bound insulin content in newly detected diabetes mellitus patients.
Free, total and antibody bound insulin blood content was studied before and after intravenous secretin injections in patients with first diagnosed diabetes mellitus and in healthy persons. The content of total and antibody bound insulin was higher and that of active free insulin comparatively lower in diabetic patients. The secretin test revealed normal beta cell reserves for the total insulin synthesis and reduced ones for free insulin formation. The treatment with protamine zinc insulin provoked spontaneous and stimulated secretion of total and free insulin. The antibody bound insulin level remained unchanged.
