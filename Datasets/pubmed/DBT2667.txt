Hepatitis B virus in diabetic patients.
The presence of HBV markers was determined in 149 serum samples obtained from diabetic patients and was compared with a normal population. Diabetics have the same incidence of HBsAg but significantly higher anti HBc antibodies. These differences were seen in the group of diabetics on oral hypoglycemic therapy. These results cannot yet be explained.
