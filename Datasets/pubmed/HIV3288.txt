Neuropathies and HIV retrovirus infections.
Neurologic complications are frequently observed during HIV related infections and particularly in AIDS. According to the literature, these complications more often pertain to the central nervous system (CNS) than the peripheral nervous system (PNS). A prospective study was carried out in order to determine the frequency and type of PNS disorders during HIV infections, the neurotropism of which is now well established. Forty one HIV infected patients   5 asymptomatic subjects, 14 ARC (AIDS related complex) and 22 AIDS patients   were studied from a clinical and biological angle; 40 equally underwent an EMG and nervous conduction velocity tests, 26 a lumbar puncture and 25 a nervous biopsy (associated in three cases with a muscular biopsy). The study showed that a PNS alteration is extremely frequent (36/41, or 88% of all cases), generally mild or even subclinical (17/36); most often, the aspect is that of a sensitive axonal polyneuropathy. More severe types (polyradiculoneuritis, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, etc.) are equally observed, but much rarer. Whatever their form may be, the PNS lesions can be observed in so called asymptomatic subjects (2/5) as well as ARC (12/14) and AIDS (22/22) patients. They are the manifestation either of a direct lesion of the nerve through HIV, or of immune mechanisms (of humoral or cellular mediation) or of both mechanisms combined.
