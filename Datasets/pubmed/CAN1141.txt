Characterization of viral RNA in Friend tumor cells having lost their capacity to produce viral particles.
Cytoplasmic RNA from Friend tumoral cells which had lost their ability to produce viral particles was analyzed for its viralRNA content. A major 32S RNA corresponding to the genome of the defective SFFV virus was detected by hybridization with a synthetic DNA complementary to the Rauscher virus genome. Very low amounts of a 34S species were also found. No 38S RNA with the size of the helper virus genome was present in the cells. It was concluded that the cessation of virus production resulted from a disappearance of the helper provirus from these cells or from a block in the transcriptional process of this provirus.
