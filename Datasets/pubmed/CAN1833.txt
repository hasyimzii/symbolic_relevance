Invasive aspergillosis with massive fatal hemoptysis in patients with neoplastic  disease.
Two patients had fatal episodes of massive hemoptysis secondary to invasive aspergillosis, complicating in one with acute leukemia and in the other with lung carcinoma. Review of the literature reveals that these cases are among the very few in which invasive aspergillosis has been documented as the etiology of massive hemoptysis in cancer patients. Both patients had been previously treated with corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents. In one of the two patients, the diagnosis was made ante mortem and antifungal therapy instituted, but dissemination progressed despite treatment.
