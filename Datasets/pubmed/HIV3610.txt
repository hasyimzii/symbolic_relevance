Visual motor coordination of AIDS patients, HIV positive asymptomatic probands and healthy persons during video tracking.
Here we investigated the applicability of a computer aided video tracking as a method for evaluating potential deficits of neural information processing in patients with AIDS and those showing only positive HIV seroreactivity. Video tracking was accompanied with a simultaneous recording of EEG. Eight HIV positive asymptomatic volunteers and eight AIDS patients with cerebral manifestation of the disease participated in the pilot study. Two groups of eight normals each served as a control. Video tracking performance of the HIV positive volunteers and AIDS patients significantly differed (p less than 0.05) from those of the healthy volunteers. Although the AIDS patients' performance tended to be worse than that of the HIV group, this difference was not significant. Power spectrum analysis of the EEG data indicated that the diminished performance of the two test groups (AIDS and HIV positives), accompanied by an increased spectral power across the entire frequency range measured in the study, could be an expression of an enhanced synchronization in cortical neuronal networks. The synchronization in turn could be a sign of possible organic brain damage resulting from HIV infection. In conclusion, we suppose that video tracking measures parameters which may indicate early deficits of information processing in CNS.
