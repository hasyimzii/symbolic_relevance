Ornithine aminotransferase in Huntington's disease.
Ornithine aminotransferase (Orn T) activities in Huntington's disease (HD) brains were found to be reduced, when compared to age matched control brains, by 34 49% in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, caudate nucleus and putamen. Such changes were not observed in senile dementia of Alzheimer type or schizophrenia. Alterations in choline acetyltransferase activities were consistent with previous findings for these disorders. If Orn T is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitter glutamate, the reported losses of Orn T activity may reflect deterioration of the corticostriatal glutamatergic neurons in HD.
