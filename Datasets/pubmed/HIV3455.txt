Recombinant core particles of hepatitis B virus exposing foreign antigenic determinants on their surface.
Insertion of foreign oligopeptide sequences (40 50 amino acids in length) into the Pro144 position of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) leads to the formation of chimeric capsids in Escherichia coli cells. These capsids are morphologically and immunologically similar to native HBcAg, but expose the inserted oligopeptides on their outer surface and exhibit antigenic and immunogenic characteristics of the latter. As a source of model antigenic determinants, the appropriate DNA copies excised from cloned viral genes such as the pre S region of hepatitis B virus, the transmembrane protein gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus 1 and the envelope protein gp51 of bovine leukemia virus have been used. The localization of the inserted antigenic determinants on the surface of chimeric capsids does not depend on the presence or absence of the arginine rich, 39 amino acid long C terminus of HBcAg.
