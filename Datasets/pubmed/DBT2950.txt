Alkaline phosphatase activity in chronic streptozotocin induced insulin deficiency in the rat: effect of insulin replacement.
Alterations in circulating alkaline phosphatase have been described in both man and the experimental animal with chronic insulin deficiency. We evaluated plasma and tissue alkaline phosphatase levels in freely fed control, streptozotocin induced diabetic and insulin treated diabetic rats, seven weeks after the induction of diabetes. Circulating alkaline phosphatase activity was markedly elevated in the insulin deficient animal (p less than 0.001) and completely normalized following insulin administration. The elevated plasma alkaline phosphatase activity observed in the insulin deficient animals was heat resistant and phenylalanine sensitive, a pattern typical of the intestinal isoenzyme. Small intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in the diabetic animals, but comparable in the insulin replaced and control rats. The intestinal isoenzyme activity was found to be strikingly insulin sensitive; withholding insulin therapy for 36 hr prior to sacrifice resulted in an abrupt rise in both plasma and intestinal alkaline phosphatase values comparable to those observed in the insulin deficient state. In contrast to these observations, skeletal alkaline phosphatase activity was decreased in the insulin deficient animal (p less than 0.01) and this abnormality was corrected by insulin replacement. Neither insulin deficiency nor insulin replacement resulted in any significant changes in the hepatic alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme.
