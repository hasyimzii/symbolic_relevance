Isolation of AIDS associated retroviruses from cerebrospinal fluid and brain of patients with neurological symptoms.
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) associated retroviruses (ARV) have been isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid and brain of homosexual men presenting with neurological symptoms. Most of these patients also met the clinical criteria for AIDS. The viruses grew readily in peripheral mononuclear cells and were identified by their induction of cytopathic effects and ARV antigens in culture. The results suggest that ARV could be the cause of the neurological syndromes in AIDS patients and indicate that the virus can infect cells other than T lymphocytes.
