Clinical history, brain metabolism, and neuropsychological function in Alzheimer's disease.
Data concerning 7 patients with a diagnosis of presumptive Alzheimer's disease (mean age, 65.6 years) are presented in detail in relation to the patients' regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose. Rates were measured by positron emission tomography with fluorine 18 labeled fluoro 2 deoxy D glucose under conditions of reduced visual and auditory stimulation. A relationship was found between severity of dementia and brain metabolism. In patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, memory and intellectual deficits were evident without major reductions in absolute metabolic rates, while ratios of regional to whole brain metabolism revealed reductions in regions of the parietal lobes. In the late, severe form of the disease, brain metabolic rates were consistently and significantly reduced. The findings suggest that memory and intellectual deficits are reflected in reductions of brain metabolism in some brain regions in mild to moderate forms of Alzheimer's disease and that, in the late, severe form of the disease, reductions occur consistently throughout the brain.
