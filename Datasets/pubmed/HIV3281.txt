The validity of immunological studies in human immunodeficiency virus infection:  a three year follow up of 235 homo  or bisexual persons.
During a three year follow up study of 235 risk group people living in Finland, we found a slow increase in the proportion of HIV seropositives (from 9.8% to 14.0%) and a slow but continuous advance in symptoms typical of HIV infection among them. The first immunological changes after HIV seroconversion were an increase in Ts cells and a decline in antigen induced T cell functions (proliferation, IL 2 production). A further decline in antigen induced responses was seen before early clinical symptoms and signs of HIV infection developed. During later phases of HIV infection the decrease of Th cells and the elevation of serum Beta 2 microglobulin correlated most strongly with the progression of HIV infection. The mitogen induced lymphocyte functions of the HIV infected correlated to Th cell levels, while the antigen induced proliferation and IL 2 production showed correlation neither to Th cells nor to Ts cells. The poor antigen induced T cell responses might be caused by abnormally functioning monocytes, known to be infected by HIV. Our results suggest that in HIV infection there is a continuous but slow disease progression, although individual variation may be great. The immunological parameter best predicting the prognosis of an infected person in the early phases of infection was the antigen induced lymphocyte functions, and later the amount of Th cells.
