Cortical abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease.
Regional cerebral glucose metabolism, an index of neuronal activity, was compared in 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 8 age matched normal volunteers by positron emission tomography following [18F]2 fluoro 2 deoxy D glucose administration. Overall cortical glucose utilization in the Alzheimer's group was 10 to 49% below that of control individuals. The posterior parietal cortex and contiguous portions of posterior temporal and anterior occipital lobes were most severely affected; frontal cortex was relatively spared. This pattern of cortical involvement is consistent with the major clinical features of Alzheimer's disease. Comparison of patients with early and more advanced dementia suggested that a substantial decline in glucose metabolism occurs before cognitive impairment becomes evident; once the patient is symptomatic, however, small additional metabolic decrements are associated with a marked deterioration in intellectual function.
