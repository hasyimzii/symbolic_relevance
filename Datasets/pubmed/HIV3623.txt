Epitope location of 13 anti gag HIV 1 monoclonal antibodies using oligopeptides and their cross reactivity with HIV 2.
A series of 15 mer oligopeptides which overlapped by five amino acids (AA) across the p24 of HIV 1SF2 and a similar series across the p18 of HIV 1SF2 were used to identify the locations of 13 anti gag monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Three anti p24 MAbs recognized sequences within the first 50 AA of the amino terminal. Another anti p24 recognized a conformational epitope in the centre of the protein and this MAb cross reacted with two HIV 2 isolates suggesting conservation of this epitope between HIV 1 and HIV 2. One anti p24 MAb recognized a linear sequence in the carboxy terminal 100 AA and one p24 antibody was assumed to recognize a truly conformational epitope as it did not react with any of the linear peptides. Four anti p18 MAbs were located at the carboxy terminus of p18 with another MAb mapping slightly inwards from the carboxy terminus and one anti p18 MAb failed to bind to the p18 peptides. The carboxy terminal distribution of the p18 MAbs indicated a highly immunogenic nature for this region in mice. None of the anti p18 MAbs showed cross reactivity with HIV 2 isolates, confirming the greater sequence variability of p18 over p24.
