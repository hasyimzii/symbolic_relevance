Neopterin estimation compared with the ratio of T cell subpopulations in persons  infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1.
We measured neopterin, a biochemical indicator for the activation of cell mediated immune reactions, in urines from 105 individuals at risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1), 83 of whom were seropositive for antibody to HIV 1. We compared absolute numbers of T cell subsets (CD4+ helper/inducer T cells, CD8+ suppressor/cytotoxic T cells), and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells with the urinary neopterin concentrations. Concentrations of neopterin in urine were inversely correlated with absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells and with CD4+/CD8+ ratios in anti HIV 1 seropositive subjects but not in those seronegative. Various statistical comparisons of the data further demonstrated that neopterin concentrations showed larger differences between anti HIV 1 seronegative and seropositive subjects than absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells or CD4+/CD8+ ratios. These results seem to indicate that neopterin concentrations increase earlier in the course of HIV 1 infection, before effects on T cell subpopulations are detectable, and may further support the suggestion that neopterin measurement could be of use for monitoring infected subjects or predicting the progression of disease.
