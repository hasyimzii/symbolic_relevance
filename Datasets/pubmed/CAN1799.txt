Epidermal growth factor stimulates production of progesterone in cultured human choriocarcinoma cells.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the production of progesterone by JEG 3, a clonal strain of human choriocarcinoma cells. Stimulation occurs in a time and dose dependent manner. In addition, EGF increases [14C] acetate incorporation into [14C] cholesterol in JEG 3 cells, and this may constitute its mechanism of action in enhancing progesterone synthesis.
