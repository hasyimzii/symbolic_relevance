Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAtc) and plasma lipoproteins in juvenile onset diabetes mellitus.
Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels and hemoglobin Atc estimates of diabetic control were measured in 19 juvenile onset diabetics (8 girls and 11 boys) upon admission (day 1) and at the end (day 25) of a 4 week summer camp, where the patients were put on a controlled diet with a daily linoleic acid intake of about 16g. Lipoproteins were also measured in 64 healthy controls. When values on day 25 were compared with those of day one, a slight but significant decrease in mean hemoglobin Atc (10.4 +/  0.3 vs. 9.8 +/  0.4% of total Hb; M +/  S.E.M.; p < 0.05) was noted, as well as in increase in mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.0 +/  0.07 vs. 1.3 +/  0.1 mmol/l; M +/  S.E.M.; p < 0.02) and a decrease in mean triglycerides (1.2 +/  0.1 vs. 0.7 +/  0.04 mmol/l; M +/  S.E.M.; p < 0.001). A linear correlation was found between hemoglobin AIc on day 25 and urine glucose excretion during the camping period (p < 0.01). However, no relationship was noted between hemoglobin AIc and either lipids or lipoproteins. Other factors, e.g. the controlled intake of saturated fat or physical activity could have responsible for the changes in triglycerides and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels noted by the end of the camp.
