Hypoxic tolerance enhanced by beta hydroxybutyrate glucagon in the mouse.
A coorelation has been observed between increased blood ketones and the tolerance of mice to hypoxia (4 5% oxygen). In previous studies fasted mice, alloxan diabetic mice and mice given 1,3 butanediol were found to be ketotic and to have increased tolerance to hypoxia. We attempted to induce a similar increased hypoxic tolerance by direct elevation of blood ketones with IV and IP beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB). No increase in hypoxic tolerance was observed with BHB alone. Inasmuch as fasting and alloxan diabetes are both associated with elevated blood glucagon (G), hypoxic tolerance tests were made 30 min after G alone or a combination of G plus BHB. The mice given G alone or BHB alone had hypoxic survival times not different from saline controls. The mice given G plus BHB had increased survival times that could not be explained on the basis of a G mediated alteration in blood BHB.
