Effect of hydrocortisone and insulin on (14C) glycine and (3H) methionine incorporation into spleen proteins in alloxan diabetic rats.
The intensity of labelled amino acid incorporation into spleen total proteins of  albino rat with experimental diabetes was studied as influenced by hydrocortisone, insulin and both hormones simultaneously. Hydrocortisone inhibits and insulin stimulates the [14C] glycine and [3H] methionine incorporation into total proteins of alloxan diabetic rat spleen. Under simultaneous administration of both hormones the inhibitory hydrocortisone effect is allayed by insulin. It is suggested that an increased level of glucocorticoid hormones in blood is one of the reasons of protein metabolism disturbance under diabetes mellitus.
