Microtubule associated protein 2: monoclonal antibodies demonstrate the selective incorporation of certain epitopes into Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles.
Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are the principal structural alteration of neuronal cell bodies in Alzheimer disease as well as in normal aging of the human brain. While the ultrastructure of these intraneuronal lesions has been extensively studied, the biochemical composition of the fibers comprising the NFT is unknown. We report the production of three monoclonal antibodies against the microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP 2), one of which intensely labels Alzheimer NFT. All three antibodies specifically recognize MAP 2 on immunoblots and stain brain tissue in a characteristic dendritic pattern. The three antibodies are directed against at least two different antigenic sites on the MAP 2 molecule, and one appears to recognize a phosphorylation site on MAP 2. That only one of the three antibodies immunolabels NFT suggests that the formation of the tangle involves some modification of the MAP 2 molecule. Our findings suggest that one aspect of Alzheimer type neurofibrillary pathology is an aggregation of MAP 2 or MAP 2 fragments with altered neurofilamentous elements present in NFT. Normal interactive function, which putatively occurs between neurofilaments and MAP 2, may thus be disrupted in Alzheimer disease.
