Urinary neopterin concentrations vs total neopterins for clinical utility.
Neopterin measurements are especially useful as an early marker in (e.g.) allograft rejections and in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1). An increased concentration of total neopterins (neopterin + dihydroneopterin) is also a significant marker in patients with HIV 1 infection. In this study we compared concentrations of neopterin and total neopterins in urine samples from 77 homosexual men with and 73 without established HIV 1 infection. HIV 1 seropositive homosexual men had higher concentrations of neopterin and total neopterins (and 7,8 dihydroneopterin) in their urine than did those who were HIV 1 seronegative, and there was a close correlation between neopterin and total neopterins. Both neopterin variables correlated inversely with CD4+ T cell counts and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios but not with CD8+ T cell counts in the HIV 1 seropositive men. Our data indicate that measurements of neopterin and total neopterins are of almost equal potential for clinical diagnosis. However, when measuring total neopterins, which includes oxidation of 7,8 dihydroneopterin to neopterin, more strict requirements of sample collection and handling are necessary to avoid degradation of the 7,8 dihydro derivative.
