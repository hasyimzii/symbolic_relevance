Formation of metastasis by human breast carcinoma cells (MCF 7) in nude mice.
MCF 7 cells, a human breast carcinoma line, forms tumors when injected into athymic nude mice. These tumors are able to metastasize to lungs, liver and spleen. 17 beta estradiol treatment increases both the growth rate and frequency of metastases. Castration or diabetes prevents metastasis formation, but treatment with estrogen or insulin restores the metastasizing capacity. MCF 7 cells secrete into the culture media collagenases able to lyse types I and IV collagens. Estrogen or insulin addition to the culture enhances collagenase production. Attention is called to the coexistence of enhancement in collagenase production and metastasis formation.
