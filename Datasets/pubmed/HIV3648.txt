The syringe dispenser project in Larvik. Experiences after one year.
Limiting the use of contaminated syringes is an important step in the battle against hepatitis B and HIV epidemics. In 1987 a project, the first of its kind, was started in Larvik and the county of Vestfold in Norway. Syringe dispensers were put up in order to ensure that drug addicts had access to sterile syringes throughout the day and night. Looking back on one year's operation, the results and reactions are positive. The programme led to increased availability of syringes, reduced use of contaminated syringes, no pollution problems of significance and a decrease in the incidence of hepatitis B. We have also been able to channel increased information to a group hitherto difficult to reach. The involvement of the local public health authorities has increased their contact with intravenous drug users. This has in turn laid the foundation for better future cooperation with this group. Setting up syringe dispensers has been shown to be an important factor in the battle against hepatitis B and HIV epidemics. This project has also provided a starting point for further work on drug abuse.
