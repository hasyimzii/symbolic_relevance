Rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder and prostate in children.
We compare 8 patients wth rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder and prostate who underwent either a radical extirpative operation, chemotherapy and radiotherapy or biopsy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The excellent survival in the former and the uniformly fatal outcome in the latter suggest that chemotherapy and radiotherapy are not substitutes for a radical extirpative operation. Indeed, proper care of these patients includes all 3 modalities.
