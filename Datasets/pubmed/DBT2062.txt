Physiopathology of non ketotic hyperosmolar coma in diabetes (author's transl).
Hyperosmolar diabetic coma is characterised by extreme hyperglycaemia and dehydration. Hypernatremia often contributes additionally to plasma hyperosmolarity. The pathogenesis of these component abnormalities is considered. The explanation of the absence of hyperketonaemia is examined in the light of recent experimental and clinical data. At the beginning of the development of the syndrome, high peripheral plasma insulin probably explains the lack of ketosis via inhibition of lipolysis. Later, when hyperosmolar coma is established, peripheral insulinopenia but an "insulinised" liver may coexist. This would favour metabolism of free fatty acids along nonketogenic pathways.
