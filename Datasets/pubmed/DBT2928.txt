Efficacy of argon laser photocoagulation in the treatment of circinate diabetic retinopathy.
We evaluated 115 eyes in 105 diabetic patients with circinate retinopathy and, in most cases, associated macular edema. Of these 115 eyes, 68 were treated with argon laser photocoagulation to leaking vessels, primarily in the center of the circinate ring. Forty seven eyes that had similar findings but received no treatment were followed up for one year and some patients were followed up for as long as three years. In each year of follow up the treated eyes did significantly better visually than the untreated eyes. The circinate complex was eliminated in 23 of the 24 treated eyes (96%) followed up for three years, whereas it disappeared in only two of the ten untreated eyes (20%). Complete resolution of macular edema, however, was achieved in only two of the treated eyes (3%) and in none of the untreated eyes. Eyes with initial visual acuities of 6/18 (20/60) or better did significantly better with treatment than eyes treated after visual acuity was less than 6/18 (20/60). The former group was the only one to show a mean improvement in visual acuity.
