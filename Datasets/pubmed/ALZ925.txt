Alzheimer paired helical filaments: identification of polypeptides with monoclonal antibodies.
Paired helical filaments (PHF) were isolated from autopsied brain of cases of Alzheimer dementia, and their polypeptides were identified with monoclonal antibodies to PHF by Western blots. The PHF polypeptide profile consisted of several bands with a size difference of less than 5 kilodalton (kDa) between adjacent bands; the most prominent bands were in the 45 62 kDa region. These PHF polypeptides were also labeled with tangles reactive antisera to microtubules from normal brain but had electrophoretic patterns different from those of microtubules and neurofilaments. These studies define the molecular weight profile of PHF polypeptides and suggest that they might originate from normal brain proteins.
