Hypoglycemia in Alzheimer's disease.
Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) were performed on patients with a) dementia of Alzheimer type, b) distal gangrene, c) cerebrovascular disease, and d) on non diabetic controls. Fasting blood sugar was significantly lower and the areas under the GTT curves were significantly smaller in the dementia group than in the other three groups. It is discussed whether Alzheimer's disease is a generalized disease not only confined to brain tissue and whether the reduced blood glucose levels could impair the brain transmitter levels.
