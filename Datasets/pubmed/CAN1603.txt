Diagnostic importance of colonoscopy in patients operated on previously for cancer of the large intestine.
Polyps, new malignant tumors and recurrent tumors along the line of anastomosis were frequently revealed in patients who had been previously operated upon for colon carcinoma. The authors examined 93 patients subjected to radical operations for carcinoma of te colon 6 months   10 years before. In 37 of them there were polyps, 3 patients had metachronous tumors and 6 patients had recurrent carcinomas along the anastomosis line. A conclusion was made that the patients previously operated for carcinoma of the colon should be referred to a group of patients previously operated for carcinoma of the colon should be referred to a group of patients with the increased oncological risk. They must be dynamically observed.
