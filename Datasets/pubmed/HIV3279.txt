Risk factors for HIV seropositivity in selected urban based Rwandese adults.
In January 1987, HIV antibodies were detected by means of an immunoenzymatic assay, indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot in 52 out of 302 male urban based professionals and in 28 out of 150 health workers in Kigali, Rwanda. Univariate analysis showed an association between HIV seropositivity and a history of sexually transmitted diseases (STD), blood transfusion, medical injections for treatment of STD, and medical injections for treatment of febrile illnesses. However, injection related to treatment of other conditions were not associated with HIV seropositivity. Among health workers, no association between HIV seropositivity and professional or accidental exposure to HIV infected patients or to their body fluids was identified. Discriminant analysis showed that HIV seropositivity was associated only with a history of STD and with a history of blood transfusion. In central Africa, a history of STD and a history of blood transfusion should be considered as risk factors for HIV seropositivity. Medical or accidental injections do not seem to play a major role in the transmission of HIV among adults in central Africa.
