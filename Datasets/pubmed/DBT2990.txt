Hormones and factors that stimulate growth of a rat islet tumor cell line in serum free medium.
A number of hormones and factors were found to stimulate growth of cultured rat islet tumor cells, the RIN r cell line. A serum free supplemented medium from RIN r cells was formulated. It consisted of a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F12 and DME media with the addition of insulin, transferrin, triiodothyronine, prolactin, growth hormone, and an extract of proteose peptone (medium IM). The growth rate of RIN r cells in this medium is as great as it is in 10% serum supplemented medium. Up to 10 populations doublings occurred over a period of 20 days. Insulin is a very effective mitogen for RIN r cells and has an effect on concentrations as low as 30 ng/ml. In addition, the insulin like somatomedin, multiplication stimulating activity (MSA), is a growth factor at 50 ng/ml. It was found that RIN r cells proliferate and continue to produce immunoreactive insulin in a hormonally and nutritionally defined medium. This medium is derived from medium IM, in which insulin is replaced with MSA and proteose peptone is omitted. Variations of this medium may prove useful in studies on the growth and function of the normal islets in long term primary culture.
