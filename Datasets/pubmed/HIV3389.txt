Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity: comparison between HTLV I and HIV 1 assays.
This study confirms the presence of detectable antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) towards both HTLV I  and HIV 1 infected cell lines, mediated by normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells and either by antibody from adult T cell lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis patients (HTLV I) or by antibody from sera of patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, AIDS related complex, AIDS and asymptomatic patients seropositive for HIV 1 infection. A comparison of ADCC towards these two retroviruses, under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, indicates major differences between the capacity of HTLV I seropositive sera and HIV 1 seropositive sera to mediate ADCC. In all cases, HIV sera showed low titre ADCC, in contrast to the high titre (greater than 1:800,000) ADCC mediated by HTLV I positive sera. Both sets of sera showed the prozone phenomenon, and heat inactivation may abolish ADCC towards HIV 1 infected cells. Quantitation of surface antigen expression on HTLV I  and HIV 1 infected cell lines indicated the presence of easily detectable amounts of virus specific antigen. We conclude that, in contrast to some previous reports, ADCC mediated by HIV 1 specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody is rather weak and of low titre when compared with HTLV I ADCC. This is true for all cell lines and HIV 1 virus isolate combinations tested.
