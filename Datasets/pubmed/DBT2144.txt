Heterogeneity of the haemoglobin A1c band in isoelectric focussing.
A double HbA1c band was demonstrated in isoelectric focussing of blood from diabetics with a fasting blood glucose above 11 mmol/l. The same band doubling was also demonstrated after incubation of erythrocytes in glucose/saline solutions. This finding may reflect the presence of the initial condensation product between haemoglobin and glucose, the Schiff base intermediate.
