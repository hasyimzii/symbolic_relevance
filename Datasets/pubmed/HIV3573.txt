Gastrointestinal cytomegalovirus manifestations in AIDS.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most important intestinal opportunistic infections in AIDS. In severe cases ulcerations and colitis are the commonest manifestations. 184 HIV positive patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were investigated by endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract. While culture, immunohistochemical staining and histology from biopsies were performed, the results of all three methods were compared. In one third the cases CMV associated lesions could be found by endoscopy. Erosions or ulcerations are the most frequent tissue lesions. In 95% the culture was positive. In addition, immunohistochemical staining in 75% and histology in 61.7% were positive in patients with more serious manifestations. For early diagnosis endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract and histological, histochemical and microbiological investigations of biopsies are essential.
