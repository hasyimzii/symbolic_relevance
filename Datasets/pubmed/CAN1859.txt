Immunologic and ultrastructural heterogeneity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated antigen positive human leukemias.
To further examine the heterogeneity of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia, an immunologic and ultrastructural study was undertaken on 14 patients positive for the acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated antigen (ALLA). In malignant cells from 7 of the patients studied, cytoplasmic granular inclusions that resembled those seen in leukemia mast cells and basophils (M B granules) were evident. Four patients had malignant cells expressing the pre B cell phenotype (i.e., cytoplasmic IgM positive and surface immunoglobulin negative), and 3 patients had malignant cells that lacked both M B granules and cytoplasmic IgM. These results support the existence of distinct phenotypic subgroups within the ALLA+ leukemias.
