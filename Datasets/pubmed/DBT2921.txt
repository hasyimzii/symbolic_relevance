Long term continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion with an implanted remote controlled insulin infusion device.
This is a report of the implantation and first 100 day operation using a remote controlled programmable insulin infusion device in an insulin dependent diabetic. To prevent insulin aggregation, a special surface active polymer developed by Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, was used as an additive. Implantation was completed on April 8, 1981, and good metabolic control was reached immediately and has continued to date (July 1981), with this unit providing the only source of insulin. There have been no hypoglycemic attacks. Patient acceptance is very good. The Siemens unit, PFA 01 (external) and DFA 01 (implanted) has proved reliable and precise.
