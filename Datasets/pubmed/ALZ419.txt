Cytomegalovirus infection and Alzheimer's disease.
Serum antibody titres to cytomegalovirus (CMV) were measured in 113 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 39 non demented controls suffering from chronic functional psychoses. AD patients and controls had similar CMV antibody titres, and conventional CMV activity was not detected in post mortem samples from eight AD patients. It is therefore unlikely that the CMV play any causal role in most cases of AD. The possession of the histocompatibility antigen HLA B15 was significantly correlated with raised levels of CMV antibody in the AD patients, which suggests that HLA B15 may be associated with an enhanced immune response to CMV.
