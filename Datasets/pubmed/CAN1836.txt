Congenital epulis of the newborn.
Two cases of Congenital Epulis of the Newborn, one treated by surgical removal, the other conservatively, are presented. In both patients the dentition erupted normally and although after five years a residual swelling remains in the patient treated conservatively, it is asymptomatic. It is suggested that the natural history of the congenital epulis is one of regression, and no treatment is required unless the lesion causes feeding or respiratory problems.
