The biological origin of ketotic dicarboxylic aciduria. In vivo and in vitro investigations of the omega oxidation of C6 C16 monocarboxylic acids in unstarved, starved and diabetic rats.
The conversion of radioactive C6 C16 monocarboxylic acids to urinary adipic, suberic, sebacic and 3 hydroxybutyric acids was investigated in vivo in unstarved, starved and diabetic ketotic rats. Hexanoic, octanoic and decanoic acids were converted to C6 , C6 C8  and C6 C10 dicarboxylic acids, respectively, in fed and 72 h starved rats. Lauric acid was converted to C6 C8 dicarboxylic acids in starved rats but not in unstarved rats. Decanoic and lauric acids were converted to relatively high amounts of C6 C8 dicarboxylic acids compared with myristic acid in myristic acid in ketotic diabetic rats, while radioactivity from [1 14C] and [16 (14)] palmitic acid was not incorporated into C6 C8 dicarboxylic acids in diabetic ketotic rats. C6 C12 monocarboxylic acids in hydrolysed rat adipose tissue wee determined by gas liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (selected ion monitoring). Decanoic and lauric acids were found in amounts of 7.6 9.1 and 85.9 137.5 micrometers/100 mg tissue, respectively, whereas the amounts of hexanoic and octanoic acids were negligible. It is concluded that the biological origin of the C6 C8 dicarboxylic aciduria seen in ketotic rats are C10 C14 monocarboxylic acids, which are initially omega oxidised solely or partly as free acids and subsequently beta oxidised to adipic and suberic acids. The in vitro omega oxidation of C6 C16 monocarboxylic acids to corresponding dicarboxylic acids in the 100,000 Xg supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenate was measured by selected ion monitoring. 0.09, 0.14, 16.1, 5.8, 7.0 and  6.9% of, respectively, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, lauric, myristic and palmitic acid were omega oxidised to dicarboxylic acids of corresponding chain lengths after 90 min of incubation, when correction for the production of dicarboxylic acids in control assays was made. An in vitro production of C12 C16 dicarboxylic acids was detected in all assays ()including control assays), probably formed from"endogenous' monocarboxylic acids preexistent in the homogenate. Ths "endogenous' production of dicarboxylic acids was inhibited by C10 C16 monocarboxylic acids, where palmitic acid had the strongest effect. In fact, palmitic acid inhibited its own omega oxidation when added in concentrations above 0.6 mM. Starvation of rats for 72 h did not alter the "endogenous' in vitro production of hexadecanedioic acid.
