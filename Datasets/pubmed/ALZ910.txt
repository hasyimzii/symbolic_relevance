Quinolinic acid neurotoxicity in the nucleus basalis antagonized by kynurenic acid.
Quinolinic acid, a metabolite of tryptophan, behaves as an excitotoxic amino acid. It has been proposed that quinolinic acid might be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. The related metabolite, kynurenic acid, has been found to be a powerful antagonist of quinolinic acid. The ability of quinolinic acid, alone or in combination with kynurenic acid, to destroy cholinergic neurons projecting to the cortex was examined by morphological and biochemical criteria. The compounds were injected unilaterally into the nbm of the rat. Neuronal destruction of the basal forebrain occurred with quinolinic acid alone; however, no cell loss was observed when kynurenic and quinolinic acid were co injected. Quinolinic acid lesions of the nucleus basalis caused significant decreases in cortical choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, high affinity choline uptake and 3H acetylcholine release. These reductions in cortical cholinergic markers were prevented by co injecting kynurenic with quinolinic acid. A significant decrease in cortical choline acetyltransferase activity was observed three months following quinolinic acid lesions of the nucleus basalis. The results indicate that quinolinic acid can be used as an endogenous neurotoxin to produce lesions of the nbm resulting in impaired cortical cholinergic function similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease.
