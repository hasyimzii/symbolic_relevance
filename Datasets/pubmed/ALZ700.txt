Excitatory aminoacid antagonists provide a therapeutic approach to neurological disorders.
Excessive excitation by neurotransmitters can cause the death of neurons. This excitotoxic action may be responsible for neuronal loss in stroke, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, ageing and Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and other chronic degenerative disorders. Compounds acting specifically to antagonise excitatory neurotransmission offer a novel therapeutic approach to these disorders.
