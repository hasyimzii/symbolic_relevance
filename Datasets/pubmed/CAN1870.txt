Oxidoreductase activities in normal rat liver, tumor bearing rat liver, and hepatoma HC 252.
Experiments were carried out to determine if the difference in rates of cell proliferation between normal and neoplastic cells may be related to altered levels of oxidative enzymes. Assays were performed using homogenates from hepatocellular carcinoma HC 252, a rapidly growing and moderately well differentiated tumor; from normal liver; and from the liver of the tumor bearing ACI rat. Results of the mitochondrial enzymes indicated that the activities of cytochrome oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase were 3 fold lower in tumor homogenates than in liver homogenates. Monoamine oxidase activity could not be detected in HC 252; mixing experiments indicated no inhibitor was present in HC 252. Activities of th peroxisomal enzymes, urate oxidase, D amino acid oxidase, and L alpha hydroxy acid oxidase were either undetected in the tumor or were 12 fold lower than in liver homogenates. The activity of xanthine oxidase, a cytoplasmic enzyme, was 5  to 6 fold lower in the tumor. Catalase activity in the tumor was also lower than in liver; this may be indicative of a lower oxidative environment at the cellular level. These enzyme activities of the liver of tumor bearing rats were in the same range as those of normal rat liver, except that D amino acid oxidase activity was slightly lower, and catalase activity was markedly lower and varied in a wide range. These results show an inverse correlation between the activities of oxygen utilizing enzymes and rates of proliferation of one tumor line and its control. The possible implications of these results in neoplasia, cell proliferation, and cellular aging are discussed.
