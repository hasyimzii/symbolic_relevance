Epinephrine maculopathy.
Epinephrine maculopathy is a reversible macular change that occurs in aphakic eyes being treated with topical epinephrine compounds. The first symptom is transient blurred vision, which can be followed by decreased visual acuity, flame shaped hemorrhages, and cystoid macular edema. Onset of symptoms can range from a few days after the commencement of epinephrine therapy to several months thereafter. Epinephrine maculopathy should be differentiated from Irvine Gass syndrome. Treatment consists of changing the patient's therapeutic regimen for glaucoma to other pharmaceutical agents. When this is done recovery of pre maculopathy visual acuity and reversal of cystic macular changes usually occur.
