Immunologic determination of an epidermal G2 chalone like factor as a marker of  squamous cell structures in the urinary bladder and urine in rats.
The epidermal G2 chalone like substance of the rat skin may be determined by immunochemical methods only in squamous epithelia and it is revealed neither in mucosa of the urinary bladder, nor in urine of control rats. The antigenic activity of the chalone was revealed in 37 extracts of 56 tumors of the rat bladder. All antigen containing tumors were found to be squamous cell carcinomas, transitional cell carcinomas with squamous cell metaplasia or possessed ultramicroscopic signs of squamous cell metaplasia appearing as "pure" transitional cell carcinomas under light microscope. The epidermal G2 chalone like substance was present in urine of 7 out of 10 rats bearing the antigen positive tumors of the urinary bladder.
