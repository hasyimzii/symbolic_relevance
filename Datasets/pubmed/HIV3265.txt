Circulation of HIV antigen in blood according to stage of infection, risk group,  age and geographic origin.
Human immunodeficiency virus antigen (HIV ag) was determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in HIV antibody (anti HIV) positive as well as pre anti HIV seroconversion sera and the results analysed according to stage of infection, risk group, age and geographic origin. Eleven (19%) of 58 homosexual men tested showed HIV ag in a serum taken 3 4 months before or one at the time of anti HIV seroconversion. In another eight (14%) HIV ag persisted after seroconversion and half of them developed AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) in contrast to none of the other 50 anti HIV seroconversions. Two (13%) of 16 haemophiliacs tested had HIV ag only in the first anti HIV seropositive sample. HIV ag was present in 86% (30/35) of Dutch homosexual men with AIDS, in 32% (7/22) of men with ARC and in 17% (24/145) of men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) or without symptoms. Three percent (2/60) of sera of asymptomatic i.v. drug users from Amsterdam were HIV ag positive. Ten percent (1 of 10) of sera from Central Africans with 'Slim Disease' were HIV ag positive. Among infected children from the USA or Europe 89 100% (8/9 and 2/2) of AIDS cases, 67 100% (6/9 and 3/3) of children with ARC and 75% (3/4) of asymptomatic children were HIV ag positive. The HIV ag EIA appears to be able to identify HIV infection earlier than the available anti HIV assays in a significant number of cases. Since persistence of HIV ag, except possibly in African cases, is strongly associated with clinical deterioration, HIV ag appears to be a suitable marker for, independent of their clinical status, selecting individuals for antiviral therapy and also for monitoring the efficiency of such therapy.
