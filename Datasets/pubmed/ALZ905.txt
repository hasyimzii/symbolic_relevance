Epinephrine induced cyclic AMP production in skin fibroblasts from patients with  dementia of Alzheimer type and controls.
Skin biopsies were obtained from six patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) and from three hospitalized age matched controls. Fibroblasts from these biopsies were grown in culture and compared for their growth characteristics and sensitivity to epinephrine with four cultures from age matched healthy individuals. The growth characteristics were similar in all three groups. The basal levels of cyclic AMP and the epinephrine induced increase of cyclic AMP levels were also similar in control and DAT cells.
