Cytogenetic studies of familial and sporadic Alzheimer disease.
We present cytogenetic findings in 7 familial and 5 sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and 34 unaffected relatives, spouses, and normal controls. Our study was prompted by reports of increased chromosome abnormalities in patients and family members at risk for AD. Coded peripheral blood chromosome preparations were evaluated for aneuploidy, aberration rates, and banding patterns. Statistical analyses of our results showed no increase in aneuploidy or aberrations in AD patients, their relatives, or normals. Chromosome loss or gain in aneuploid cells was not specific except in two individuals. These two older persons studied, one with AD and one unaffected, were observed to have increased sex chromosome aneuploidy. This finding was attributed to aging and was not considered to be an effect of AD.
