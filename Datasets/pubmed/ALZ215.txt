Immunological parameters in Alzheimer's pre senile dementia.
Serum immunoglobulin levels and C3 and C4 complement concentrations were assayed  and serum tested for the presence of autoantibodies in 17 patients with pre senile Alzheimer's disease. The majority of patients showed a reduced level of one or more of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA or IgM. No significant abnormality was found to indicate an autoimmune disorder.
