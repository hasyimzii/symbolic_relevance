Evaluation of anterior pituitary function in patients with posttraumatic diabetes insipidus.
Serum LH, FSH, TSH, PRL, GH, and cortisol were measured in 10 patients with posttraumatic diabetes insipidus both basally and after a combined insulin induced hypoglycemia, LRH and TRH test. Two patients did not show hormonal abnormalities, while 8 patients had deficiencies of 1 or more hormones. The most frequent abnormality was GH deficiency (50%), followed by TSH (40%), ACTH (30%), FSH (30%0, and LH (20%). These results indicate that anterior pituitary dysfunction frequently accompanies posttraumatic diabetes insipidus.
