Digital subtraction angiography of the human cardiovascular system.
Initial clinical application of a system for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to the human cardiovascular system in 88 patients is reported. The equipment consisted of a specially designed computer system integrated with a fluoroscopic and radiographic apparatus for digitization, manipulation, and display of data. After intravenous injection of contrast material, adequate visualization of the heart and carotid, thoracic, abdominal, and femoral arteries was obtained with sufficient quality to obviate conventional angiography in many clinical settings. In this mode, nonselective opacification is obtained. However, DSA was also used to extend the capability of selective angiography. The availability of quantitative information permitted the determination of rates of transit of contrast material in various organs which may give insights of their physiologic performance.
