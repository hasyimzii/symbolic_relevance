Antimyristoylation of the gag proteins in the human immunodeficiency virus infected cells with N myristoyl glycinal diethylacetal resulted in inhibition of virus production.
The gag proteins of human retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1) are specifically myristoylated in their amino termini (1, 2, 3). N myristoyl glycinal diethylacetal (N Myr GOA) and other N Myr compounds (N Myr Gly GOA, N Myr Gly Gly GOA and N Myr Gly Gly Gly GOA) were newly synthesized and investigated for activity of antimyristoylation of these gag proteins and for influence on viral replication. Of the N Myr compounds tested, N Myr GOA most severely inhibited the protein myristoylation; N Myr Gly GOA also inhibited it, but moderately. Furthermore, it was observed that N Myr GOA at 20 microM caused noticeable inhibition (about 80%) of the production of mature HIV in the HIV 1 infected MT 4 cells. In this system, N Myr GOA substantially inhibited more than 90% of the N myristoylation of p17 gag protein produced in the HIV 1 infected MT 4 cells. These results suggest that the N myristoylation of p17 gag protein of HIV 1 may be essential in its structural assembly or maturation.
