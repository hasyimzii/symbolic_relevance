EEG and SPECT in cerebral manifestations of AIDS.
The purpose of the presented study was to determine the diagnostic value of correlated EEG and SPECT findings in patients with CNS manifestations of AIDS. Ten HIV 1 infected patients had been examined. Diagnoses: meningitis (2 x), lymphoma (2 x), necrotizing encephalitis (1 x), toxoplasmosis (7 x) (Some patients had more than one diagnosis). Unenhanced and Gd DTPA enhanced MR, 99mTc HM PAO SPECT and clinical EEG were compared. In 9/10 patients MR demonstrated intracranial lesions. In one patient with necrotizing encephalitis (not detected by MR), SPECT revealed an inhomogeneous cerebral perfusion. Only lymphoma was hyperperfused. Toxoplasmic lesions when detectable by SPECT were hypoperfused. Reduced rCBF was also seen in brain regions not affected directly, but functionally associated to altered areas. EEG revealed diffuse signs such as slowing in patients with brain atrophy, but also in those patients with lesions of basal ganglia and thalamus. Focal signs in the EEG were in concordance with imaging findings in only 2/10 patients. In 4/10 patients foci even adjacent to the cortex   as shown by MR   remained undetected by EEG. One patient with an active toxoplasmosis had sharp waves over the affected region. The parallel application of the three methods as suggested in this paper appears useful not only for scientific purposes. In most cases, this procedure provides relevant diagnostic information. It is recommended for AIDS patients with CNS manifestations of unknown etiology.
