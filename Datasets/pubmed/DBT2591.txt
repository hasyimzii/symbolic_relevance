Diabetic diets: high carbohydrate combined with high fiber.
The ideal level of carbohydrate intake for diabetics placed on high fiber diets is unknown. Nineteen diabetics, therefore, took part in a total of twenty four 5 day studies of fiber supplementation (guar) with carbohydrate intakes ranging from 22 to 61% of total calories. Where carbohydrate formed more than 40% of the calorie intake, there was a mean 64% reduction in glycosuria over the last 2 days on guar (P < 0.001, 14 studies, 11 patients). No significant reduction in glycosuria was seen in the 10 studies on lower carbohydrate intakes. This suggests that dietary fiber supplements in diabetes should be given against a background of higher rather than lower carbohydrate intake.
