Infection of human gastrointestinal cells by HIV 1.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1) infected and replicated in primary cultures  of normal human ileal and colonic epithelial cells. Monocyte tropic strains (ADA, 24, and 36) were better able to replicate in the gastrointestinal (GI) cells than the T cell tropic HIV strain HTLV IIIB. In some cultures, virus replication persisted through several months. Intestinal epithelium may be an initial target and reservoir for HIV and a vector for virus dissemination and transmission.
