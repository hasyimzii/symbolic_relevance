HTLV III monitoring in prostitutes in Vienna.
Since the end of May 1985 registered Viennese prostitutes are regularly screened  for HTLV III/LAV antibodies. Up to the end of January 1986 839 prostitutes had been investigated and 7 of them (0.8%) revealed positive test results. 5 persons are intravenous drug addicts, whilst 2 only admitted connection to drug addicts. Furthermore, HTLV III antibodies were detected in 1 non registered prostitute and in 5 men (3 homosexuals, 2 drug addicts). 11 out of these 13 seropositive patients have confirmed lymphadenopathy syndrome, whilst latent infection has to be assumed in the remaining 2 cases.
