Experiences with homologous umbilical cord veins in vascular reconstructive surgery.
12 homologous umbilical cord veins prepared according to the method of MINDICH from February to November 1978 were used as either femoro femoral or femoro popliteal bypass. 6 of the 12 implanted umbilical veins after an average of 4 months were still open and showed good results, whereas 4 were blocked by thrombosis due to bad outflow conditions or dissection. On two implants that had had to be removed, histological examinations were used, and these showed a destruction of the graft's wall. In contrast to the advantages of their problem free availability and good technical suitability stands the destruction of these grafts observed by us and hence the questionable nature of tenacity in the receiver. Further experiences of longer duration dealing with this interesting subject of vascular substitute are needed.
