Evaluation of solitary simple renal cysts in children.
Because there is a proportionately higher incidence of solid renal neoplasm in children than in adults early operative intervention is more common in these cases. For this reason the most important consideration when evaluating children is to exclude the presence of a malignant neoplasms. The clinical features, radiologic manifestations and management of solitary simple renal cysts in 3 children are discussed. We suggest that the increased accuracy and availability of newer imaging techniques now permit this entity to be managed in a fashion similar to its more common adult counterpart. Surgical exploration should be reserved for those cases in which there is doubt as to the benign nature of the cyst.
