N,N' Dialkylbis(dichlorophenyl)ethylenediamines and  imidazolidines: relationship between structure and estradiol receptor affinity.
Diastereomeric N,N' dialkylbis(dichlorophenyl)ethylenediamines and the corresponding imidazolidines with chlorine in the 2,4, 2,6, 3,4, and 3,5 positions were synthesized. Only the stereoisomers of the 2,6 dichloro substituted compounds exhibit for N CH3 (2e, 3e), N C2H5 (2f, 3f), and N C3H7 (2g, 3g) an affinity to the estradiol receptor (Ka values ranging from 9.1 X 10(4) to 9.1 X 10(6)), because the nitrogen atoms are shielded by the ortho located chlorine atoms; therefore, a binding interaction with hydrophobic receptor areas is possible. These substances show weak uterotrophic activity and no significant effect on the growth of the DMBA induced hormone dependent mammary adenocarcinoma of the rat.
