Clinical and cisternographic differential diagnosis between presenile dementia and Hakim syndrome.
The authors compared with regard clinical and the radionuclide cisternography examination 27 patients with Hakim Syndrome and 11 with Alzheimer Disease. In all cases, dementia was a stable symptom. Patients with Hakim Syndrome have an early gait disturbance, ataxia and epileptic seizures. Only in case of patients with Alzheimer Disease we found aphasia, apraxia and psychotic disorders. 24 hours after the injection radionuclide cisternography showed ventricular retention and absence of parasagital accumulation only in patients with Hakim Syndrome. Lighter changes (mixed cisternographic pattern) were found in patients with Alzheimer Disease as well.
