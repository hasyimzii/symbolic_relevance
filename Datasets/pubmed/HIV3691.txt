Prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 DNA in hemophilic men and their sex partners. Hemophilia AIDS Collaborative Study Group.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells to assess in hemophilic men whether any were HIV seropositive but uninfected or seronegative but infected and in seronegative sex partners of seropositive hemophilic men whether any were infected. Of 40 seropositive men, 38 (95%) were PCR positive; one was PCR indeterminate and one PCR negative. None of 41 seronegative men who used only donor screened, virus inactivated coagulation factor products were PCR positive. However, two of six who received noninactivated products were PCR positive; one had low T helper cell counts and died of unrelated causes and the other had seroconverted 11 mo later. PCR with a second primer pair also detected HIV 1 DNA in these two men. None of 25 seronegative female sex partners of seropositive men, including six men with AIDS and seven with AIDS related symptoms, were PCR positive. These data suggest that most seropositive hemophilic men are HIV infected; whether some are infected with defective virus remains to be resolved as does the infection status of seropositive PCR negative men. Identification of two seronegative PCR positive men supports the possibility that HIV 1 DNA can be detected before seroconversion.
