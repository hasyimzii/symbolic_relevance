Combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) for non Hodgkin's lymphomas with unfavorable histology: preliminary results.
From January 1978 to June 1979, 29 selected, previously untreated patients with unfavorable histology of non Hodgkin's lymphomas (12 DPDL, 7 DM, 9 DH and 1 DU) were submitted to the combination chemotherapy CHOP (cyclophosphamide, 750 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1; adriamycin, 50 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1; vincristine, 1.4 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1, and prednisone, 100 mg p.o. on day 1 through 5) every 21 days. Eighteen patients were in early stage (I or II) and 11 of them were also submitted to involved field radiotherapy (60Co), immediately before (stage I) or during (stage II) the chemotherapy, with a mean dosage of 4,500 rad. The remaining 11 patients were in advanced stage (III or IV) of disease and were treated with chemotherapy alone. We obtained 20 complete remissions (68%), 8 partial remissions (28%) and 1 no response (4%) to therapy. Sixteen of 18 patients (89%) in early stages and 4 of 11 patients (36%) in advanced stages achieved a complete remission. The bone marrow toxicity of the chemotherapy was moderate. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were frequent but well controlled by the support therapy. The actuarial survival rate of patients, after 18 months of follow up, is 41% (40% in complete remission). The patients who achieved a complete remission are alive and 65% of them still relapse free. We believe that the combination chemotherapy CHOP improves the complete remission rate as well as the survival of patients with unfavorable histology of non Hodgkin's lymphomas.
