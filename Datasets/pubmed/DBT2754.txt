Sauna induced acceleration in insulin absorption from subcutaneous injection site.
The effect of the Finnish sauna on insulin absorption from a subcutaneous injection site was examined in eight insulin dependent diabetic patients by measuring externally the disappearance rate of 125I labelled rapid acting insulin. The sauna (twice for 25 minutes at 85 degrees C) accelerated insulin absorption by 110% as compared with room temperature (p < 0.01). After the sauna blood glucose concentrations were 3.0 3.3 mmol/1 (54.1 59.5 mg/100 ml) lower than on the control day (p < 0.05). The fall in blood glucose values was proportional to the increased rate of insulin absorption (r = 0.30; p < 0.01). The hypoglycaemic effect of a sauna in insulin treated diabetics is clearly at least partly due to enhanced insulin absorption from the injection site. Such an effect might be prevented by taking a snack or reducing the insulin dose.
