Prostacyclin as a protective factor for blood vessels.
Prostacyclin is a very unstable prostaglandin, which is continuously synthetized  and released by blood vessels. It fulfills 2 main functions, namely strong inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation. Thus it acts as an important defense mechanism of the vascular wall, which is directed against overwhelming platelet aggregation and against the development of atherosclerosis. Besides endogenous prostacyclin is an important antihypertensive factor. In several diseases, as diabetes mellitus, obliterative arteriopathy and haemolytic uraemic syndrome, the reduced prostacyclin synthesis is thought to be a key mechanism for the development of vascular lesions. On the other hand the haemorrhagic diathesis of uraemics is seen in connection with an increased vascular prostacyclin release. Synthetic prostacyclin is now under trial for therapy in peripheral obliterative arteriopathy and extracorporeal circulation, as haemodialysis and cardiopulmonary bypass.
