Choline chloride fails to improve cognition of Alzheimer's disease.
Seven mildly to moderately demented patients with Alzheimer's disease were treated with either placebo or choline chloride (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/24 hrs) in a double blind, crossover study. Detailed psychometric analysis was carried out at the end of each two week period of drug or placebo administration. No subjects showed significant overall improvement at any dose level despite more than a doubling of the baseline plasma choline level.
