Oligoclonal bands in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HIV infection.
Matched samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 15 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients were examined after isoelectric focusing. The appearance of oligoclonal bands only in the CSF could indicate the primary HIV infection of CNS in early stages of the disease. Later, the increasing number of autochthonous oligoclonal bands in the CSF suggested locally synthesized IgG against opportunistic infections. Because of the immunodeficiency, T cell independent polyclonal B cell stimulation might mask the oligoclonal pattern.
