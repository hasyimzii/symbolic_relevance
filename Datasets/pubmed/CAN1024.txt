DNA cross linking and monoadduct repair in nitrosourea treated human tumour cells.
The 1 (2 chloroethyl) 1 nitrosoureas are potent anti cancer drugs which produce DNA inter strand cross links in a two step reaction sequence. The first step was proposed to be an addition of a chloroethyl group to a guanine O6 position of DNA; the second step, which occurs over a period of several hours in the absence of free drug, could then form an interstrand cross link by the slow reaction of the bound chloroethyl group with a nucleophilic site on the opposite DNA strand. The delay between the formation of chloroethyl monoadducts and the formation of inter strand cross links allows time for a DNA repair mechanism, capable of removing the monoadducts, to prevent the cross linking. We recently proposed this mechanism to account for a difference in inter strand cross linking between a normal and a transformed human cell strain. Day and his coworkers (see refs 7, 8 and previous paper) found that some human tumour cell strains (designated Mer  phenotype) are deficient in the ability to repair O6 methylguanine lesions in DNA. We therefore hypothesized that the repair function that removes O6 methylguanine residues from DNA would also remove chloroethyl monoadducts and hence prevent chloroethylnitrosourea induced inter strand cross linking. We now present evidence that supports this hypothesis and indicates also that the O6 methylguanine repair confers resistance to cell killing by chloroethylnitrosourea.
