Seropositivity to LAV/HTLV III in 11 European countries.
The ECP Working Group on AIDS has evaluated data on seropositivity to LAV/HTLV III supplied by members in II Western European countries. The period covered is 1981 84. The rise in LAV/HTLV seropositivity parallels the incidence of cases of AIDS in the different countries. LAV/HTLV now spreads freely within Europe and spread has become less dependent upon promiscuity. The epidemic is about to enter Eastern Europe. Intravenous drug abusers appear to be the risk group experiencing the most rapid spread at present. Furthermore, seropositivity in males and females outside the traditional risk groups seems on the rise, and as in the US the percentage seronegative in individuals with PGL is quite high. AIDS is rapidly becoming a major cause of cancer in young adults. A coordinated European preventive effort is urgently needed.
