The effects of parabiosis on serum and kidney glycosidase activities in spontaneously diabetic mice.
Spontaneously diabetic non obese mice of the ICR strain were newly inbred in Shionogi laboratory, Japan. Animals became diabetic suddenly, more frequently and severely in females. Blood glucose levels were 452 +/  73 mg/100 ml with serum insulin levels of less than 1.0 microU/ml in the fed state. Parabiosis with normal control ICR mice for 2 weeks decreased the blood glucose level to 260 +/  51 mg/100 ml (P less than 0.01) and resulted in serum insulin levels of 46.0 +/  18.0 microU/ml (P less than 0.01). Kidney homogenate beta N acetylglucosaminidase and beta galactosidase activities were reduced in diabetic mice (42% and 44% decreases respectively) (P less than 0.025 and P less than 0.001), and restored almost to normal after 2 weeks of parabiosis. Renal alpha mannosidase activity was decreased 43% (P less than 0.001) in the diabetic mice but unaffected by parabiosis. Serum beta N acetylglucosaminidase, beta galactosidase and alpha glucosidase activities were significantly increased in diabetic mice (179%; 233% and 58% increase respectively) (P less than 0.005, P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.001), and returned to normal with parabiosis.
