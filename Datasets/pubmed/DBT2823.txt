Monolayer cultures of adult pancreatic islet cells on osmotically disrupted fibroblasts.
A simple method that permits the attachment of fully dissociated adult pancreatic islet cells to culture dishes, using osmotically disrupted fibroblasts, is described. Using this system, monolayer cultures consisting of either isolated or clustered adult endocrine islet cells can be readily established in standard culture media.
