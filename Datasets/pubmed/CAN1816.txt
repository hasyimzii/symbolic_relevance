Node positive breast cancer: a comparison of clinical and pathological findings and assessment of axillary clearance.
The Breast Adjuvant Chemotherapy Study of the Anti Cancer Council of Victoria was set up to encourage the cooperation of clinicians from many centres who are involved in the management of early node positive breast cancer in Victoria. Data sheets were completed by participants, and an analysis was made of the first 100 registered patients to determine the reliability of clinical assessment related to pathological findings and to study the extent of axillary node clearance. Although all subjects were histologically node positive, 47 had no palpable axillary lymph nodes, and in only 38 were nodes considered to be clinically involved. Correlation between clinical and pathological measurements of breast tumour size was significantly better (86%) with tumours over 5 cm in extent than with tumours of 5 cm or less (70%). Total mastectomy with total axillary clearance was the most common operative procedure performed. The pectoralis major was preserved in 97 and the pectoralis minor was divided or removed in 71 cases as part of the axillary clearance. In a subgroup (33) the location of involved nodes in the axilla was studied, and of these seven (21%) were found to have involved upper axillary nodes in the absence of lower axillary nodal involvement, emphasizing the inadequacy of axillary sampling in determining nodal status.
