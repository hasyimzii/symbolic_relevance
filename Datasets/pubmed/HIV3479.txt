Serology of HIV infection.
Serological testing aimed at the detection of antibodies against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is now performed throughout the world to screen stored blood for transfusion, for the diagnosis of HIV infection and of AIDS, and to determine the prognosis of AIDS patients. The present report, based on 258,090 serum samples screened for HIV antibodies, gives an overview of the theoretical and practical aspects of both modern screening methods and confirmation tests for HIV1 and HIV2, the demonstration of serological antigen and IgM, and HIV serology of the cerebrospinal fluid. Knowledge of HIV serology appears to be important for any physician, and in particular for the dermatologist, since HIV infection (like syphilis) can cause a variety of dermatological manifestations mimicking other dermatoses.
