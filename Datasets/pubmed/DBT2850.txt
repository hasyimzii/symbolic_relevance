Reversible mild diabetes in children after treatment with chlorpropamide.
In 9 patients with juvenile onset chemical diabetes treated with oral chlorpropamide, oral or intravenous assessments of carbohydrate tolerance were made regularly three weeks after withdrawal of therapy. 6 patients with sequential intravenous tests achieved statistically significant reversal of their carbohydrate intolerance and have remained normal for an average of 5.6 years (range 1 11 years). 2 patients who subsequently required insulin therapy were maintained in remission for 3.5 years and 5 years, respectively. There appears to be a group of young patients with chemical diabetes who achieve significant remission with sulphonylurea therapy.
