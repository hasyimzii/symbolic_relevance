Age, senile dementia and ventricular enlargement.
Necropsy measurements of cerebral ventricular volume and pericerebral space in senile dementia patients and age matched controls indicate that ventricular enlargement is not an accurate diagnostic marker for cerebral atrophy. Furthermore, ventricles are of normal size for age in about 40% of all senile dementia patients including those with Alzheimer's disease.
