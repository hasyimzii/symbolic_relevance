Noninvasive assessment of vascular disease in the lower limbs of diabetics.
One hundred and fifty seven limbs of diabetic patients free of any symptoms or signs of arterial insufficiency, were studied using noninvasive techniques to determine vascular distensibility in the lower extremities. A relationship between these values and the classification of the diabetic in terms of age, duration of diabetes and control of diabetes was sought. The results revealed a distinct inverse relationship between vascular distensibility and age of the diabetic subject, analogous to the trend found in a normal, non diabetic group of volunteers. Furthermore, comparison of distensibility in normal and diabetic subjects within the same age group showed lowered values among the diabetics. However, the study revealed little or no apparent relationship to either duration or control of diabetes.
