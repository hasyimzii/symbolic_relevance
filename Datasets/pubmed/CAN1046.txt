Immunological classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (author's transl).
Immunological markers in acute lymphoid leukemia complete the cytological study and allow a new classification. 44 cases of acute lymphoid leukemia were investigated for the presence of T and B membrane markers on bone marrow and/or peripheral blood lymphoblasts. 20 per cent of cases had T lymphoblasts: 10 90 per cent of the lymphoblastic cells exhibited T cells markers (E Rosetting). 10 per cent of cases had B lymphoblasts: these cells have shown monoclonal surface immunoglobulin. 70 per cent of cases had "non T, non B" lymphoblasts: some of these lymphoblasts formed EAC Rosettes. These techniques of lymphocytes studies are fruitful in furthering understanding of the structure function relationship of these cells.
