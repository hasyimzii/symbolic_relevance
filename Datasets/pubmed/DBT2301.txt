Growth of the fetal biparietal diameter in different types of pregnancies.
A total of 24,560 fetal biparietal measurements were made using the B scan technique. The increase in biparietal diameter was compared in normal pregnancies, in those complicated by diabetes or toxemia, and in fetuses thought to be small for dates. Only the last of these groups demonstrated a statistically significant difference.
