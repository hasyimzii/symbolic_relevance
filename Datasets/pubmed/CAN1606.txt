Criteria in the malignant degeneration of chronic stomach ulcers.
Carcinoma of the stomach was revealed in 34,4% of patients with continuous gastric disorders. Early carcinoma was found only in 10% of them. The authors believe that the measures aimed at the detection of early forms of carcinoma should be taken in the group of an increased oncological risk. The conservative treatment of patients with gastric ulcer should be preceded by endoscopy with verification. The indications for the surgical treatment of the ulcer must be determined before the development of complications.
