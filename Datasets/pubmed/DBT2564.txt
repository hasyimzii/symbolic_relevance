Plasma trivalent chromium, glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in juvenile  and adult onset diabetes mellitus.
The relation between plasma trivalent chromium (Cr3+), glucose tolerance and insulin secretion was studied in healthy volunteers and in patients with juvenile  or adult onset diabetes mellitus. Cr3+ levels before and during the oral glucose tolerance test were not significantly different in the three groups, whereas glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were impaired in the diabetics. Our results indicate that plasma Cr3+ behavior does not reflect impairment of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in diabetes mellitus.
