U100 insulin and the general practitioner.
On August 1 1980, U100 insulins (100 units/mL) will be introduced and other strengths will be phased out over four months. During that period all insulin dependent diabetics will need to be seen and helped to adjust to their new dosage volume. The new system is decimal, and provided the new appropriate syringes are used, much more simple. Experience has shown that mistakes in dosage are much fewer with U100 insulins. General practitioners will be in the forefront of the campaign to educate patients.
