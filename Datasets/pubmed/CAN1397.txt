Gray scale sonographic spectrum of hypernephromas.
The sonographic appearances of 43 proved hypernephromas was characterized and correlated with the angiographic and pathologic features. This report details the findings and emphasizes the criteria for recognizing poorly echogenic tumors, which may be confused with cysts. A diagnostic dilemma may be posed by these tumors, particularly if angiography shows no evidence of tumor neovascularity. The end point in diagnostic work up of these tumors must be based upon a correlative approach utilizing the clinical, urographic, sonographic, and angiographic data.
