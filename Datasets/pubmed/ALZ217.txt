Pick's disease. A clinical, computed tomographic, and histologic study with golgi impregnation observations.
We studied a case of pathologically confirmed Pick's disease. Several of the clinical and computed tomographic (CT) features may be helpful in making an in vivo diagnosis of the disease. In addition, the Golgi impregnation studies showed a unique dendritic histopathologic pattern not previously encountered in any of the degenerative dementias.
