Establishment of pancreatic insular function in embryonic development.
The reactivity of the pancreas in normal and in decapitated in utero fetuses from mothers with experimental diabetes was evaluated from the increased insulin secretion in vitro in response to glucose and theophylline. It was shown that B cells of the islet system in the pancreas of normal fetuses from animals with alloxan diabetes are capable to react to glucose from the 18th day of the prenatal life while those from normal mothers from the 21st day. Removal of the nervous and endocrine regulation centres in fetuses decapitated in utero leads to the loss of the sensitivity to glucose in fetuses both from normal and diabetic mothers.
