Inhibition of HIV replication by 3' fluoro modified nucleosides with low cytotoxicity.
From a series of newly synthesized 3' fluoro modified nucleosides the C 5 chloro substituted derivative of 2',3' dideoxy 3' fluorouridine (FddUrd) and the 4 thio analogue of 2',3' dideoxy 3' fluorothymidine (FddUrd) emerged as the most efficient and selective anti HIV agents. Their antiviral doses (ED50) proved to be 700 and 480 fold below their toxic doses (CD50) in MT 4 cells. The 50% inhibitory dose of cell proliferation of the 5 chloro substituted FddUrd and its parent agent FddUrd was found to be in the millimolar range for various other human cell lines and for mouse CFU GM. The 5' triphosphate of FddUrd as well as of its 5 Chloro derivative are demonstrated to be two of the most active and selective inhibitors of the HIV reverse transcriptase (IC50 = 0.07 +/  0.01 and 0.04 +/  0.006 microM).
