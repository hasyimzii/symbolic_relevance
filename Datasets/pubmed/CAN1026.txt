Defective repair of alkylated DNA by human tumour and SV40 transformed human cell strains.
We have identified a group of 8 (among 39) human tumour cell strains deficient in the ability to support the growth of adenovirus 5 preparations treated with N methyl N' nitro N nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), but able to support the growth of non treated adenovirus normally. This deficient behaviour defines the Mer  phenotype. Strains having the Mer  phenotype were found to arise from tumours originating in four different organs. Relative to Mer+ strains, Mer  tumour strains showed greater sensitivity to MNNG produced killing, greater MNNG stimulated "DNA repair synthesis and a more rapid MNNG produced decrease in semi conservative DNA synthesis. Here we report that (1) Mer  strains are deficient in removing O6 methylguanine (O6 MeG) from their DNA after [Me 14C]MMNG treatment (Table 1); (2) Mer  tumour strains originate from tumours arising in patients having Mer+ normal fibroblasts (Fig. 1a, b); (3) SV40 transformation of (Mer+) human fibroblasts often converts them to Mer  strains (Fig. 1c, d); (4) MNNG produces more sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in Mer  than in Mer+ cell strains (Fig. 2).
