Self esteem, social support, internalized homophobia, and coping strategies of HIV+ gay men.
The relationship was examined between self esteem, social support, internalized homophobia, and coping strategies used by HIV positive (HIV+) gay men (N = 89) and between the use of coping strategies and mood state. Multiple regressions were conducted with avoidant (escape avoidance, accepting responsibility) and proactive (seeking social support, planful problem solving) coping serving as criterion variables. Greater homophobia and less self esteem predicted avoidant coping, whereas less homophobia and less time since diagnosis predicted proactive coping. Greater time since diagnosis, less avoidant coping, less homophobia, and greater self esteem predicted better mood state and accounted for 50% of the total variance.
