Studies of teratomas in mice: possibilities for the future production of animal models.
The murine teratoma teratocarcinoma has become an interesting model for the study of neoplastic transformation, developmental biology, and possibly a useful system for genetic studies. These tumors arise spontaneously in 129 strain mice and can be induced in other strains by transplanting early embryos or portions of embryos into extrauterine sites. The majority of these tumors are benign, but some are capable of transplantation due to the presence of the stem cell, embryonal carcinoma, which is a multipotential cell able to proliferate and also differentiate into tissues and cell types representative of all the embryonic germ layers. It has been elegantly shown by transplantation of embryonal carcinoma cells into blastocysts which are then placed into a pseudopregnant mouse that a normal mouse is obtained composed of cells from the host blastocyst and also cells from the malignant embryonal carcinoma. Therefore, under this set of circumstances, embryonal carcinoma cells are induced to functionally differentiate into multiple cell and tissue types which are benign and able to contribute to the development of a mouse. The adaptation of the embryonal carcinoma cell to tissue culture has allowed the manipulation of these cells with subsequent selection of mutant cells which can be further transplanted into blastocysts to obtain a mouse which contains these mutant cells. If the mutant cells have populated the germ line, it may be possible to obtain a stock of mice with the lesion present in all cells. This system may be exploitable for studies in neoplasia, developmental biology, and with proper selection procedures, allow the development of new genetic strains of mice.
