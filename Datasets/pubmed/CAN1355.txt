Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in a patient with Hodgkin's disease.
This is a report on a 78 year old patient with Hodgkin's disease of mixed cell type in stage III B, who, because of his age, underwent only mild cytostatic therapy. Two months after beginning of treatment, cerebellar neurological symptoms developed. He died of bronchopneumonia 3 months later. At autopsy progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with multiple demyelinated areas in the cerebellum was established. Paracristallinic structures within nuclei of glial cells resembling papovavirus formations were detected by electron microscopy.
