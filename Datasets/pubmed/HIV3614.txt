Role of electroencephalography in the neurological diagnosis of HIV.
Neurological diagnosis in HIV patients is usually impeded by nonspecific technical findings and the multiplicity of AIDS associated neuromanifestations. Despite its limited specificity EEG is of great diagnostic value in patients afflicted by the most common primary neuromanifestation, i.e., AIDS encephalopathy. In the setting of an advanced HIV infection with typical symptoms and absence of focal neurological signs, parietooccipital slowing of the EEG basal activity may allow the diagnosis of AIDS encephalopathy. Additional advantages of the EEG method consist of its non invasive nature and the feasibility of repeated examinations for follow up. Although in secondary neuromanifestations the diagnosis will usually be established by CCT or MRI, focal EEG changes may be of additional diagnostic value.
