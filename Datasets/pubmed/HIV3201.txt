Time relationship of immune changes to HTLV III/LAV seroconversion in patients with hemophilia.
Longitudinal immune studies of patients with hemophilia A were begun in 1982 by the Regional Hemophilia Center in St. Louis, Missouri. Serum samples collected from 74 participants between 1982 and 1985 were analyzed for antibody to human T lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III)/lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV). The incidence of antibody to HTLV III/LAV has increased significantly in this population of patients with hemophilia. Only one of eight hemophiliacs had detectable antibody before July 1982, whereas 88.7% (55/62) were positive in 1985. T cell surface markers were markedly abnormal in seropositive hemophilia patients with decreased percentage and number of OKT4 positive cells compared with seronegative hemophiliacs and controls. Lymphoproliferative responses to mitogens and antigens were normal in seronegative hemophilia patients. Seropositive hemophiliacs, compared with seronegative hemophiliacs, had significantly decreased lymphoproliferative responses, especially to pokeweed mitogen, tetanus, and Candida stimulations. Immune studies of seven HTLV III/LAV seropositive hemophiliacs revealed antigen unresponsiveness and decreased T4 cells 2 to 32 months prior to development of full blown AIDS. Longitudinal immune studies from 1983 85 revealed increasing number of seropositive hemophiliacs with antigen unresponsiveness and decreased T4 cells.
