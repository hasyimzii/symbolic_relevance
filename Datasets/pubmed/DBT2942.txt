Carbohydrate infusion in internal diseases. A comparative study of metabolically healthy persons and liver disease and diabetic patients. III. Glucose infusion over a 48 hour period.
6 metabolically healthy control persons, 6 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 6 patients with diabetes were infused for 48 hours with a 20 % (w/v) glucose solution. The infusion rate was 0,25 g glucose/kg body weight and hour. A constant surveillance of the metabolical status was performed by control of 39 different laboratory values. In all 3 groups, glucose infusion alone was sufficient for basal metabolic rate. This was shown by the inhibition of lipolysis as well as in the decreased catabolism. Only the diabetic group exhibited high blood sugar values and an energy loss up to 10 % of the administered glucose. We could not observe any side effects.
