A modified spectrophotometric test for nitroblue tetrazolium reduction of granulocytes and monocytes and its application for testing inhibition of monocytes by serum components in tumor patients.
For evaluation of serum factor involvement in monocyte function, we established a modified quantitative spectrophotometric nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test. We investigated the stimulation of human peripheral monocytes and granulocytes by zymosan, endotoxin, and Corynebacterium parvum in vitro. In addition, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) function in a patient with non Hodgkin lymphoma was studied during the course of polychemotherapy and intravenous application of Corynebacterium parvum (C. parvum). In non Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 15) and bronchogenic carcinoma (n = 11) the NBT reduction of autologous monocytes in presence of autologous serum in relation to a AB serum was decreased compared to a control group of age matched healthy blood donors. The sera from patients with these neoplasms inhibited NBT reduction of monocytes from healthy donors. This inhibition showed a correlation to the presence of immune complexes in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma.
