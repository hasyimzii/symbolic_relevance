Chemotherapy versus chemoimmunotherapy for small cell undifferentiated carcinoma  of the lung.
Thirty eight patients with small cell carcinoma were treated with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and VP16 213 + or   MER. Response and survival of the six patients who received radiotherapy prior to entering the study were inferior compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone. Of 32 previously untreated patients, 13 had limited and 19 had extensive disease. Ninety seven percent of these 32 responded and 63% achieved complete remission (CR). All patients with limited disease had a response and 77% achieved CR. Patients with extensive and limited disease had 91/2 months (range 1 26 months) and 14 months (range 31/2  42 + months) median survival, respectively. The median survival for all complete responders irrespective of extent of disease was 16 months (range 6   42 + months). Three patients with limited disease are disease free more than 34 + months and off all therapy 10 + to 18 + months. Eighteen of 38 patients required antibiotics for fever during neutropenia. Eight patients had MER fevers and nine had serious infections. There were four drug related deaths. MER therapy did not influence response rate, drug toxicity, or survival, but did add morbidity. This combination chemotherapy alone is an effective treatment for previously untreated small cell lung cancer patients regardless of extent of disease.
