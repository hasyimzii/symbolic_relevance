Detection and antigenic distribution of hepatitis B virus in liver tissue and its relation to other serological markers of viral replication.
The aim of this work has been the production of specific monoclonal antibodies against HBV antigens and their utilisation in order to study their distribution on liver tissue. The monoclonal antibodies anti HBc and anti HBs were obtained by the modified hybridoma technique. This study was performed on 50 patients affected by several chronic hepatopathies. For the detection of the antigens, avidin biotin peroxidase complex immunostaining was used. Both cytoplasmic and membranous HBsAg were detected in 15 out of 16 HBsAg+ patients; 8 of 12 HBsAg /anti HBc+ patients and 1 HBsAg /antiHBc  patient. Cytoplasmic and nuclear HBcAg was observed in 12 of 16 HBsAg+ patients and 4 of 20 HBsAg  patients. Although the presence of serum HBsAg is an index of liver infection, in some HBsAg /antiHB+ patients (20%) with undetectable levels of HBsAg, hepatic injury may be disclosed by the detection of other markers of active viral replication.
