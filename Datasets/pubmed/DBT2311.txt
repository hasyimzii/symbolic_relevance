Effect of Bordetella pertussis vaccine on glucagon secretion in normal and alloxan dogs.
The effect of Bordetella pertussis vaccine on plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon secretion was investigated in normal and alloxan dogs. On the 8th day after the vaccine injection, in normal and alloxan dogs during the infusion of arginine and glucose, the plasma glucose level was lower and the IRI level was higher than in the saline controls. On the other hand, the plasma IRG level showed no significant alloxan dogs this vaccine made the plasma IRG level lower during arginine infusion than in the saline controls and suppressed it significantly during glucose infusion. These effects of the vaccine disappeared on the 30th day after its injection into normal and alloxan dogs. It is suggested that in normal dogs Bordetella pertussis vaccine decreased plasma glucose through the promotion of insulin secretion without any effect on glucagon secretion, while in alloxan dogs this vaccine might alleviate hyperglycemia through the enhancement of insulin and the inhibition of glucagon secretion.
