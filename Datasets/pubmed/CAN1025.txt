1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D3 increases synthesis of the vitamin K dependent bone protein by osteosarcoma cells.
Rat osteosarcoma cells respond to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 with a 6 fold increase in intracellular and secreted levels of the vitamin K dependent protein of bone (BGP). The rise in intracellular BGP levels is half maximal at 6.6 h and precedes the rise in medium BGP levels by 6 h, a time course which is consistent with the postulated steroid hormone action of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3. This effect is achieved by physiological levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, with half of the maximal response at a vitamin concentration of 0.04 ng/ml. The specificity of this effect for BGP is demonstrated by the absence of a 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 effect on total protein synthesis by these cells. To our knowledge, BGP is the first example of a bone protein whose rate of synthesis is dramatically and specifically increased by physiological levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3. The possible functions of BGP in the biological actions of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 on bone are discussed.
