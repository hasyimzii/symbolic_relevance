Hypersensitivity vasculitis and granulomatous hepatitis induced by glybenclamide: a case report (author's transl).
The second case in the medical literature of hypersensitivity vasculitis induced  by glybenclamide is reported, and for the first time vasculitic lesions are demonstrated in the histopathological study of liver tissue. The case was a male patient admitted because of a febrile illness and generalized malaise of long duration. He had diabetes mellitus that was being treated with glybenclamide. Physical examination disclosed fever, poor general condition, hepatomegaly, and red nodes in the finger tips of both hands. Abnormal laboratory parameters included normochromic normocytic anemia, leukocytosis with a high eosinophil count, and markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. There was as well slight cytolysis and marked elevation of cholestatic serum enzymes without hyperbilirubinemia. Biopsy of the skin lesions demonstrated anular granulomata, a common lesion in diabetics. The histopathological study of the liver revealed a vasculitic hypersensitivity reaction with conspicuous granulomata located in the vicinity of blood vessels and in the wall of portal arterioles, the endothelium of the latter being disrupted at different levels. Glybenclamide withdrawal resulted in a clinical, biological and histopathological cure of the disease. Unlike the previously reported case, the patient remains alive, and this may partly have been due to early institution of corticosteroid therapy.
