Glucagon, growth hormone, and cortisol response to insulin induced hypoglycemia  in insulin dependent diabetics (IDD) without autonomic neuropathy (author's transl).
Insulin induced hypoglycemias are a sign of non sufficient counterregulation, in  which different contra insulinary hormones participate. The aim of the study was to investigate, whether there exists a difference between IDD and non diabetics regarding secretion of glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone during an insulin induced hypoglycemia and further on pointing out, expecially, the importance of glucagon. Insulin induced hypoglycemias are counterregulated in non diabetics, not in IDD. The missing glucagon secretion during insulin induced hypoglycemia in IDD seems to be independent from an autonomic neuropathy. Only after high doses of exogenous glucagon can one see a counterregulating increase of glucose. The STH secretion is similar in non diabetics and IDD during an insulin induced hypoglycemia and has evidently only a secondary effect in hypoglycemic counterregulation. The STH secretion may be the expression of a diencephal triggered stress situation. The cortisol secretion is the same in both groups. The gluconeogenetic effect of cortisol is not sufficient to accomplish a fast compensation of hypoglycemia. This does not exclude long term effects. When inhibiting the secretion of insulin and different contra insulinary hormones with somatostatin, one is able to demonstrate that glucagon alone is a sufficiently counterregulatory hormone in insulin induced hypoglycemias.
