Brain destruction alone does not elevate brain aluminum.
Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to measure aluminum concentrations in brain samples from 33 patients dying from a variety of neurologic diseases. Four samples from patients dying of nonneurologic causes also were studied. Nine samples (one from each of nine patients) of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease brain contained normal amounts of aluminum. Aluminum was increased in 9 of 18 brain specimens with seven different pathologic processes. This included three of seven Alzheimer disease, two of three Huntington disease, two of two Parkinson disease, one of one progressive supranuclear palsy, one of one acoustic neuroma, one of two cerebrovascular disease, and one of two Guamanian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Aluminum was normal in the remaining samples (four normal, two ALS, one multiple sclerosis, one Pick disease, and two Guamanian parkinsonism dementia). The significance of high aluminum values is not clear, but the normal values from the Creutzfeldt Jakob cases imply that neuronal destruction per se need not lead to accumulation of aluminum in the brain.
