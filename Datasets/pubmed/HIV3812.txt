Human immunodeficiency virus infection in Singapore  the first 50 cases.
As at 31 May 1990, fifty Singaporeans with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection had been detected. Of these, nineteen had the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The majority of infected persons had been infected through sexual contact (homosexual 52%; bisexual 24%; heterosexual 20%) with men and women from countries where HIV infection was prevalent. The majority of infected patients (88%) were in the age range 20 39 years. There was one case of blood transfusion associated AIDS. There were no infected paediatric or haemophiliac cases or intravenous drug use in any of the patients. A spectrum of AIDS related opportunistic infections and cancers was observed, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was the most frequent presentation. Thirteen patients with AIDS had died and the median survival time was about seven months.
