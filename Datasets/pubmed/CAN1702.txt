Oral contraceptive history as a risk indicator in patients with pituitary tumors  with hyperprolactinemia: a case comparison study of twenty patients.
This report presents a retrospective case comparison study of 20 hyperprolactinemic patients with pituitary adenomas treated at the Mount Sinai Hospital (1976 1079). An association between oral contraceptive (OC) use and 20 subjects with pituitary tumors was substantiated using discordant paired analysis. The comparison group consisted of appendectomy patients admitted during the same time period and matched for sex and age. The estimated relative risk was 4.0 (P less than 0.025). This study suggests that there is a significant association between OC use and pituitary tumors associated with hyperprolactinemia.
