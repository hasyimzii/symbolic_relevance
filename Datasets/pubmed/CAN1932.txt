Ultrasonic evaluation of the pancreatic duct.
In a prospective ultrasound study of 253 patients, the lumen of the normal pancreatic duct of Wirsung could be demonstrated in 82% of the patients. The mean diameter of the normal pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) was 1.3 mm. The duct of Santorini occasionally could be demonstrated. A duct of Wirsung greater than 2 mm in diameter should be considered dilated. The pancreatic duct is dilated in most patients with acute pancreatitis, in some patients with chronic pancreatitis, and in some patients with pancreatic tumor.
