Nocturnal, daytime, and postural changes of plasma aldosterone before and during  dexamethasone in adenomatous and idiopathic aldosteronism.
The relative importance of ACTH and the renin angiotensin system for control of aldosterone was studied in eight patients with adenomatous primary (APA) and four with idiopathic aldosteronism (IHA). Plasma aldosterone (PA) and cortisol (PC) were measured in blood collected during the night at 15 min intervals between 0500  0800 h by integrated sampling on day 1 and in casual samples during the daytime while patients were in the upright and in the supine position (days 1 and 2, at 1200, 1600, and 2000 h). PRA was measured in all daytime samples. On days 3, 4, and 5, 2 mg dexamethasone were given, and the same protocol for blood sampling was repeated on days 4 and 5. During the night, mean PA in IHA patients was markedly lower than that in APA patients. PA patients correlated with PC in both groups. Dexamethasone reduced the mean nocturnal PA in both groups to equal proportions. In the daytime, the mean recumbent PA in IHA patients was also significantly lower than that in APA patients but was equal in both groups while subjects were in the upright posture. Daytime PA significantly correlated with PC in APA patients and with PRA in IHA patients. During upright posture, dexamethasone did not reduce daytime PA in either group. In the supine position, dexamethasone reduced daytime PA values in APA but not in IHA patients. Thus, short time fluctuations of PA during the night are equally influenced by ACTH in APA and IHA patients, though at markedly different levels of aldosterone production. During the daytime, the influence of ACTH on PA remains apparent in the group with APA. However, the renin angiotensin system seems to play a predominant role in the control of PA during the daytime in patients with IHA. During dexamethasone and ACTH suppression, PA in APA patients rises in response to upright posture as it does in IHA patients.
