An initial step in the induction of cancer, the loss of histone H1 from chromosomes   a hypothesis.
Unexpected blood group antigens of the P and ABO blood group systems have been found on gastric carcinoma cells of some individuals whose red cells did not possess the antigens and whose sera contained the corresponding antibodies. On the basis of the known biosynthetic pathways leading to the synthesis of the antigens, and on the concept that the blood group genes involved control the structure of glycosyltransferases, it seems that the individuals possess the respective glycosyltransferases structural genes which are not expressed in normal tissues. However, the genes have become expressed in the carcinoma cells.
