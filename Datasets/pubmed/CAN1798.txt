Thymoma production of T cell growth factor (Interleukin 2).
Phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate stimulates a subline of mouse EL 4 thymoma cells  to produce, in vitro, in very high titer, T cell growth factor (Interleukin 2, IL 2). The EL 4 derived IL 2 has the same m.w. (30,000) and isoelectric point heterogeneity (pI 3.8 4.4) as the IL 2 produced by Con A stimulated spleen cells. In addition, the thymoma derived IL 2 exhibits the same spectrum of biologic activities as has been reported for spleen cell derived IL 2.
