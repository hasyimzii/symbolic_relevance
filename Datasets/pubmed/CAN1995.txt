Results of curative, distal resection of stomach neoplasms.
Between 1962 and 1971 there were operated 99 patients suffering from gastric cancer. From these, 83% could be controlled as long term follow up. The overall survival rate after one year was 68%, after three years 40% and after five years 36%. The patients with tumor free lymph nodes showed a 5 year survival rate of 49% while of those with tumor involved lymph nodes only 17% lived longer than five years. The survival rate, especially of older patients (above 60 years), showed with a distal gastric resection compared to a total gastric resection a significant lower postoperative mortality, a better quality of life and a better survival rate. A total gastric resection should only be indicated in cases in which a radical tumor resection could not be realized with a distal gastric resection.
