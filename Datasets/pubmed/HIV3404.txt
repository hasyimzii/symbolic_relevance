Cohort study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody testing among patients receiving long term dialysis at a university hospital.
In a longitudinal study to determine the seroprevalence of antibody to the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the natural history of a positive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) result we followed a cohort of 98 patients receiving long term dialysis. Eight patients (8.2%) in the cohort had a positive EIA and a negative Western blot test result. The EIA positive results of all patients seroconverted to negative during follow up. No illness suggestive of HIV infection developed in any of the patients. Significantly associated with a false positive EIA were prior renal transplantation, transfusions during the months just before the positive EIA result, and a greater number of lifetime transfusions before the positive test result. We confirm that routine HIV screening of patients receiving long term dialysis is associated with a high rate of false positive EIA results and conclude that such testing is unnecessary in the absence of established risk factors for HIV infection.
