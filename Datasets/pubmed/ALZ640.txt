Decreasing the burden in families caring for a relative with a dementing illness. A controlled study.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a specifically designed group support program for relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. The group program included educational/supportive activities and used basic principles of the cognitive behavioral approach. Twenty two subjects participated in an eight session program. Eighteen control subjects received no treatment. Measures of family burden, levels of depression, and knowledge of dementia were obtained. Experimental subjects showed a significant decrease in total family burden, whereas control subjects actually showed a significant increase, experimental subjects also showed reduction in their levels of depression. Experimental subjects showed a significantly greater improvement than did control subjects on knowledge of dementia. The acquisition of new knowledge was an important ingredient in reducing perception of burden and levels of depression, but other facets of the intervention also accounted for the improvement. Results indicated that a relatively short but intensive support experience can have a positive effect in reducing some of the burden and depression associated with the care of a demented relative.
