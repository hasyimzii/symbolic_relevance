Slow wave sleep in elderly depressed, demented, and healthy subjects.
The application of automated analysis in the measurement of sleep electroencephalogram delta activity allows a more precise temporal description of slow wave sleep changes in normal and pathological aging than do standard, all night, slow wave sleep measures. Thus, with a baseline crossing technique, elderly depressives were shown to have a higher delta count per minute during the second NREM sleep period than did controls or demented subjects. This difference reflected greater activity per minute in the 2 3 Hz frequency band (75 200 microV).
