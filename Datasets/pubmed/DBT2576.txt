Clinical evaluation of measuring glycosylated hemoglobin levels for assessing the long term blood glucose control in diabetics.
The glycosylated hemoglobin levels were determined in the hemolysates obtained from 14 normal subjects and 67 patients with adult onset diabetes mellitus, using the column chromatographic procedure of Trivelli et al. The levels of hemoglobin A1a+b (HbA1a+b) and HbA1c and the sum of HbA1a+b and HbA1c (HbA1a+b+HbA1c) in normal subjects averaged 2.3 +/  0.4 (SD)%, 5.3 +/  0.8% and 7.6 +/  1.0%, respectively. Although a slight increase in HbA1a+b was found in patients with diabetes mellitus (mean +/  SD=2.8 +/  0.7%), it was not significantly different from that in normal subjects. Despite the wide range, HbA1c and HbA1a+b+HbA1c were significantly increased in patients with diabetes mellitus (6.9 +/  1.8% for HbA1c, p < 0.01 and 9.7 +/  2.2% for HbA1a+b+HbA1c, p < 0.01). A significant correlation existed between the glycosylated hemoglobins and plasma glucose levels determined in the same blood (r = +0.57, p < 0.001). Moreover, the glycosylated hemoglobin levels correlated significantly with the average glucose levels for several months preceding the hemoglobin measurements. In particular, a striking correlation was evident in the plots of HbA1a+b+HbA1c against the mean plasma glucose for 3 months prior to the hemoglobin measurements, which had a correlation coefficient of 0.79 (p < 0.001). The present findings revealed that the glycosylated hemoglobins reflect the time averaged blood glucose levels in diabetics for during approximately the proceeding 3 months, indicating the usefulness of measuring the glycosylated hemoglobins in assessing the long term blood glucose control in diabetics.
