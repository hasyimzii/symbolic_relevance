Immunological classification of lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemias (author's transl).
Lymphocyte surface immunoglobulin, E rosettes and EAC rosettes were studied in 91 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia of well differentiated lymphosarcoma and 16 patients with poor differentiated lymphosarcoma (including lymphoblastic lymphoma and histiocytic lymphoma of Rappaport). The tests were performed on the malignant cells in peripheral blood or in lymph nodes. In well differentiated proliferation only one had T malignant cells. All the others had B malignant cells. In poor differentiated proliferation: 50 per cent of cases had "B" lymphosarcoma cells, 21 per cent of cases had "T" lymphosarcoma cells, 29 per cent of cases had "non T, non B" lymphosarcoma cells. These results show the heterogeneity of both functional aspects and stages of maturation in lymphoma cells.
