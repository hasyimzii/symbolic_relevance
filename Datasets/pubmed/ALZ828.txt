Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in senile dementia (Alzheimer type) and in non organic behavioural disorders in the elderly; comparison with EEG parameters.
Forty two patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type were compared with  normal subjects (51) and with elderly patients with nonorganic psychiatric disorders (40). All were examined by EEG (routine visual inspection and power spectrum density analysis) and VEP (pattern reversal) testing. In dementia the late components (N130, P165, N220) of the VEP are delayed, but the EEG was abnormal more often than the VEP.
