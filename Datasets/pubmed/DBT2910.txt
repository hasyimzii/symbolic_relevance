Plasma C peptide in long standing type 1 diabetics with and without microvascular disease.
Plasma C peptide levels were measured both in the fasting state and in response to a standard breakfast in 37 Type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetics with severe proliferative retinopathy, 20 Type 1 diabetics without complications and 13 non diabetic subjects. The two diabetic groups were matched for age and duration of diabetes. Seventeen out of 37 subjects with diabetic complications had detectable C peptide compared with three out of 20 in the group without complications (p less than 0.05). There was a significant correlation between fasting C peptide levels when present and the increment in C peptide (r = 0.89, p less than 0.0001). There was no correlation between C peptide levels and the fasting blood glucose or HbA1. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that in long term diabetics, sufficient beta cell function may persist which measurably influences diabetic control and prevents the development of microvascular complications.
