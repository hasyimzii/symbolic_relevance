Quantification by gas chromatography of N,N' di (2 chloroethyl) phosphorodiamidic acid in the plasma of patients receiving isophosphamide.
A sensitive method, based on gas chromatography using a phosphorus specific flame photometric detector, has been developed for quantifying N,N' di (2 chloroethyl)phosphorodiamidic acid (isophosphoramide mustard), the putative active metabolite of isophosphamide, in human plasma. Phosphoramide mustard was used as internal standard, and the two compounds were converted into separable trimethyl derivatives by reaction with methyliodide in the presence of silver oxide. The chemistry of the derivatization process has been elucidated using gas chromatography electron impact mass spectrometry and selected ion monitoring. Levels of isophosphamide and of isophosphoramide mustard were measured in the plasma of patients receiving isophosphamide (2 g/sq m). Peak plasma levels of isophosphoramide mustard of 18.6 to 30.3 nmol/ml occurred at 2 to 4 hr, and levels were still appreciable (6.3 to 11.3 nmol/ml) at 24 hr.
