Health promotion strategies for prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection among minority adolescents.
Programs designed to increase self protective behaviors are urgently needed to avert a marked increase in HIV infection among minority adolescent populations. AIDS interventions which neglect any component of the prevention triad severely limit potential for positively impacting on adolescent risk behaviors. Proactive programs which integrate these equally critical components, on the other hand, have a greater likelihood of achieving maximal outreach and effectiveness, and consequently preventing the spread of HIV infection among minority adolescent populations.
