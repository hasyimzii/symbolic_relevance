Incidence and significance of candidiasis in biopsy material of gastric ulcers (author's transl).
121 cases of candidiasis were histologically demonstrated in the course of histological studies of gastric mucosal biopsies in 20 401 patients. Infestation of necrotic tissue with Candida albicans was found exclusively in patients with gastric ulcer, ulcerating carcinoma or lymphoma. Candidiasis was twice as common in carcinoma as in non carcinomatous gastric ulcer. In the majority of those patients with ulcer who also had Candida albicans mycosis there was was at the same time atrophic or dysplastic gastric mucosa at the edge of the ulcer. Demonstration of candidiasis in biopsy material from gastric ulcer should thus be interpreted as suspicious of carcinoma, until and unless further studies confirm or exclude it.
