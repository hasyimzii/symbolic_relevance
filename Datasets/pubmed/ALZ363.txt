Decreased cortical glucose utilization after ibotenate lesion of the rat ventromedial globus pallidus.
Rats received unilateral injections of ibotenic acid (12 micrograms) or vehicle in the ventromedial globus pallidus to lesion the primary source of cortical cholinergic innervation. At 3 or 28 32 days postinjection, the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRglu) was measured by the 2 deoxy D [14C]glucose technique in nine cortical areas, the anterior thalamus, and the dorsal hippocampus. Effects of oxotremorine (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) on rCMRglu in these areas were assessed in ibotenic acid lesioned and sham treated rats. Significant effects of ibotenic acid injections and hemispheric asymmetries in rCMRglu were observed in all cortical areas (p less than or equal to 0.05), but not in the anterior thalamus or hippocampus. Cortical rCMRglu generally was lower in the lesioned hemisphere 3 days after ibotenic acid injections, but not after sham treatments. Hemispheric asymmetries were not apparent 28 32 days after pallidal lesions. Oxotremorine produced significant effects in the frontoparietal cortex and anterior thalamic nuclei. In the frontoparietal cortex, rCMRglu was 32% lower in the ibotenate lesioned hemisphere as compared with the contralateral hemisphere. Oxotremorine did not eliminate hemispheric asymmetry, but increased rCMRglu in the lesioned frontoparietal cortex by 38%. Results support the views that cortical metabolic decrements in Alzheimer's disease are due in part to loss of subcortical cholinergic innervation and that muscarinic agonists may partially reverse these decrements.
