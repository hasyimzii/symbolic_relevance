Stereomorphometric studies of capillaries and nerve cells in the normal brain of the aged subject and in Alzheimer's disease.
Stereological investigations of putamen, frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus in Alzheimer's disease and in age matched controls were performed with an optical electronic image analysis system (Leitz). In all layers of the frontal cortex, a significant atrophy of neuronal perikarya is observed in Alzheimer's disease compared with normally aged specimen. In putamen, a non significant decrease is measured in the area of nerve cells. The morphometric results of the capillary measurements show a 40% increase of the capillary volume in the brain cortex of the Alzheimer group compared with the controls. These results which are probably localized in cortex represent gross atrophy of the frontal brain in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. No changes of this kind can be observed in young individuals (19 45 years) or the normal aged group (85 95 years).
