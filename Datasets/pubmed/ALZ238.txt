The substantia innominata in Alzheimer's disease: an histochemical and biochemical study of cholinergic marker enzymes.
Acetylcholinesterase staining was examined in the substantia innominata of 3 normal human brains. Large intensely stained neurones were seen within the region of the basal nucleus of Meynert which is believed to be the origin of the cholinergic projection to the neocortex in animals. On the basis of the acetylcholinesterase staining pattern, the substantia innominata was dissected from post mortem brain tissue of 19 cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 16 controls so as to include the basal nucleus. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was found to be reduced in the substantia innominata and amygdala in AD but not in the adjacent lentiform nucleus and hypothalamus.
