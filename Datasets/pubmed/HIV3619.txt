Rapidly progressive non A, non B hepatitis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
No information is available on the role of non A, non B hepatitis in the various  hepatic abnormalities described in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Of 97 patients referred with suspected non A, non B hepatitis, 3 were found to have antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus. These latter 3 patients all developed symptomatic cirrhosis within 3 yr of onset of hepatitis. Such a rapid progression of liver disease was rare in patients with non A, non B hepatitis who did not have simultaneous human immunodeficiency infection. These findings suggest that human immunodeficiency virus infection may potentiate the liver injury of chronic non A, non B hepatitis.
