Purification and characterization of cytoplasmic 14C arginine rich basic proteins of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells.
Arginine rich basic proteins from cytoplasm of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells have been separated and partially characterized. All proteins show a cationic character with the following isoelectric points: 8.45, 8.60, 8.70, 8.90, and possess various amount of arginine. The protein of the highest molecular weight (75000) has the greatest amount of arginine (18.1%), specific radioactivity (19760 cpm/mg, min) and isoelectric point (8.9). The significance of those proteins in the cytoplasm of tumor cells has been discussed briefly.
