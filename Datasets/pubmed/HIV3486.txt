Low antigenicity of HIV 1 rev: rev specific antibody response of limited value as correlate of rev gene expression and disease progression.
An enzyme immunoassay based on an E. coli produced HIV 1 rev gene product was used to detect rev specific antibodies in longitudinally collected serum samples from 196 initially symptom free men who were seropositive for antibodies to HIV 1 structural proteins and 72 men who seroconverted for such antibodies. In 61% of men no rev specific antibodies were detected at all, 30% had persistently detectable rev specific antibodies, and in 9% rev specific antibodies were only transiently or intermittently detected. When a persistent rev specific antibody response occurred in subjects who seroconverted to structural proteins, it was always, with one exception, found within 12 months of seroconversion. The rev specific antibodies were also studied in a transectional sample of sera from the men who remained symptom free and from those who developed AIDS related conditions or AIDS, as well as in sera from 31 other men with AIDS related conditions and in sera from 6 of these men at the time they developed AIDS. The rev specific antibodies were found in 34% of symptom free men, in 28% of patients with AIDS related conditions, and in 16% of patients with AIDS. The low incidence of rev specific antibodies early after infection may be due to low antigenicity of rev. The lower prevalence of rev specific antibodies in sera from patients with AIDS, compared with patients with AIDS related conditions and symptom free HIV 1 infected individuals, may be explained by a progressive HIV 1 induced immunodeficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
