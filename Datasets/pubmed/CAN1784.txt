Surface markers of lymphocytes infiltrating seminoma tissue.
Infiltrating lymphocytes were separated from human seminoma tissue obtained surgically. The relative distributions of B and T lymphocytes, and a subset of T lymphocytes with IgG Fc receptors were measured by the rosette forming method in peripheral blood and in seminoma tissue from 7 patients with pure seminoma of the testis. The proportions of T and TG cells were increased in seminoma tissue compared to those of peripheral blood from the same patients, whereas the proportion of B cells did not change. This result might correlate with the favorable prognosis of seminoma usually accompanied with lymphocytic infiltration.
