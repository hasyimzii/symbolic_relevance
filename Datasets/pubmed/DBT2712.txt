Aspects of the T and B lymphocyte surface architecture in chronic internal diseases with immune component. Scanning electron microscopy studies.
Investigations on the T and B lymphocyte surface architecture were carried out by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in 102 patients with various chronic internal diseases such as chronic hepatitis, diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a.o. The clinical and biological examination performed in these cases reveled also some cytochemical, biochemical and immune disturbances. Emphasis is laid on the superiority of SEM, as compared with the E and EAC rosette tests, for the identification of T and B lymphocytes. Moreover, by detecting certain cellular anomalies, SEM can provide useful indications regarding the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of the above mentioned diseases. Association of SEM with other clinical and laboratory investigations can either confirm, disapprove or even enhance the value of the morphological findings by electron microscopy.
