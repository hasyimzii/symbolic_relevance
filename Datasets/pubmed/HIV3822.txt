HIV infection risk to nonhealth care workers.
As has been summarized above, the risk of casual contact transmission of HIV virus is remote. A review of these data should provide reassurance to both workers and management. No evidence exists for direct contact spread through shaking hands and nonsexual touching. There is also no evidence for indirect spread through contact with shared inanimate objects such as typewriters, telephones, computers, water fountains, rest rooms, dining facilities, exercise equipment, bathing facilities, spas, saunas, and swimming pools. In addition, there is no evidence to suggest the airborne spread of HIV, thus there should be no potential risk of transmission through air conditioning units, air handling systems, or by sharing the same office space with an infected individual. The fear of AIDS may lead to irrational beliefs and biased perceptions of risk. This, unfortunately, can sometimes lead to discriminatory and inhumane treatment of persons with AIDS. The best way to manage this potential problem in the workplace is through effective educational interventions.
