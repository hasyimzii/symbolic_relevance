HLA genotype studies in juvenile insulin dependent diabetes.
HLA genotypes were ascertained in 53 French Caucasian families, comprising 68 juvenile onset insulin dependent diabetic siblings. Among the 49 alleles detected at different loci in the HLA complex (A, C, B, Bf, DR) 4 appeared to occur at a significantly higher frequency among the 53 index cases than in a control series of 116 healthy individuals: HLA B18 (p < 10( 3)), DRw3, DRw4 and BfF1 (p < 10( 6)). The excess of HLA identical affected siblings confirms genotype disequilibrium and supports the hypothesis of an HLA linked gene(s) conferring susceptibility. There was no increase of homozygosity for HLA DRw3 and DRw4 whereas there was a marked excess heterozygosity for HLA DRw3/DRw4 in diabetic patients (32% versus 0% in the control series, p < 0.001). These data provide evidence for the existence of two cooperating genes, linked to each of the HLA DR alleles.
