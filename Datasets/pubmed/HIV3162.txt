Isolation of the human T cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type III from aqueous humor in two patients with perivasculitis of the retinal vessels.
The human T cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III) has been isolated from aqueous humor in two patients with perivasculitis of the peripheral retinal vessels, an AIDS related ocular manifestation. Both patients had antibodies to HTLV III and although they presented with herpes zoster ophthalmicus, they did not present other symptoms known to be associated with HTLV III infection. The isolation of HTLV III from aqueous humor in these two patients with retinal perivasculitis suggests that the virus itself may play a role in the etiology of this ocular sign. The presence of infectious HTLV III in the anterior chamber further emphasises the necessity to discard corneas from HTLV III infected donors.
