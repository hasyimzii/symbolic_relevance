Differences in lateral hemispheric asymmetries of glucose utilization between early  and late onset Alzheimer type dementia.
Positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose revealed greater right  than left hemispheric impairment of cortical glucose metabolism in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease who were younger than 65 but not in those over 65. This asymmetry was related to poor visuospatial performance.
