The role of nutrition in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and in cerebral functions: clinical implications.
Much experimental evidence shows that intracerebral synthesis of various neurotransmitters (serotonin, acetylcholine, and catecholamines) may be affected by the amount of their respective precursors (tryptophan, choline and tyrosine)in food. Changes in cerebral functions secondary to the administration of each of these three precursors have been reviewed in physiological and pathological conditions, and in particular in different neuro psychiatric diseases due to a lack of synthesis or release of neurotransmitters. Possible interactions between digestive and cerebral diseases are considered in relation to lack or excess of precursors.
