Recommended infection control policies for patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. An update.
HIV is not readily transmitted to health care workers, even after accidental parenteral exposure to infected blood. Existing guidelines for reducing exposure to blood and other body fluids will protect workers who care for patients infected with this pathogen. New infection control guidelines for patients with AIDS are therefore not required. Awareness of the potential for nosocomial transmission of HIV has resulted in a renewed respect for the principles and practice of infection control. The procedures that the task force recommended to prevent contact with body fluids will reduce exposure not only to HIV but also to other potentially contagious pathogens in the health care environment. Implementation and enforcement of these guidelines for all patients could greatly reduce the incidence of nosocomial and occupationally acquired infections.
