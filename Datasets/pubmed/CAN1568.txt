Epitheliomas of the lateral margin (author's transl).
The third part ends the study on epitheliomas of the laryngeal margin and concerns 8 cases of epithelioma of the lateral margin (aryteno epiglottic fold and intersection of the three folds). The authors emphasize the considerable lymphatic tropism of these tumors. In 58% of these, enlarged lymph nodes were found, 65% of which showed histological involvement. Best results (survival and local sterilisation) are provided by surgery, partial or complete, depending on the T stage, the tumoral site, and combined with lymphadenectomy, completed by irradiation.
