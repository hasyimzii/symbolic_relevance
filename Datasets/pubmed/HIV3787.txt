No T cell tyrosine protein kinase signalling or calcium mobilization after CD4 association with HIV 1 or HIV 1 gp120.
The T lymphocyte surface protein CD4 is an integral membrane glycoprotein noncovalently associated with the tyrosine protein kinase p56lck. In normal T cells, surface association of CD4 molecules with other CD4 molecules or other T cell surface proteins, such as the T cell antigen receptor, stimulates the activity of the p56lck tyrosine kinase, resulting in the phosphorylation of various cellular proteins at tyrosine residues. Thus, the signal transduction in T cells generated through the surface engagement of CD4 is similar to that observed for the class of growth factor receptors possessing endogenous tyrosine kinase activity. As CD4 is also the cellular receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), binding of the virus or gp120 (the virus surface protein responsible for specific CD4+ T cell association) could mimic the types of immunological interactions that have previously been found to stimulate p56lck and trigger T cell activation pathways. We have evaluated this possibility and report here that binding of HIV 1 or the virus glycoprotein gp120 to CD4+ human T cells fails to elicit detectable p56lck dependent tyrosine kinase activation and signalling, alterations in the composition of cellular phosphotyrosine containing proteins, or changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration.
