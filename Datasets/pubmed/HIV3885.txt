Astrocyte conditioned medium stimulates HIV 1 expression in a chronically infected promonocyte clone.
Human promonocytic cells chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) (clone U1.1.5) were grown in the presence of media conditioned by primary rat cortical astrocytes and HIV 1 expression was assessed by measuring reverse transcriptase activity. Media conditioned by non stimulated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated astrocytes induced the expression of HIV 1 2.1 fold and 4.1 fold, respectively. LPS alone, media conditioned by the uninfected parental cell line of U1.1.5 (U937), and culture media from four other cell lines, had no effect on viral expression. The magnitude of induction was time  and dose dependent. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was detected in LPS stimulated astrocyte conditioned medium and the HIV inducing capability of the medium was neutralized, in part, by an antibody to recombinant murine TNF alpha. These results suggest a role for astrocytes in the induction of HIV expression and thus in the pathogenesis of HIV 1 infection in brain.
