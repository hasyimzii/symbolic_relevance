The effect of human cord plasma on the incorporation of 3H thymidine by PHA stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes of cervical cancer patient (author's transl).
It has been proposed that human cord plasma can suppress the PHA response of adult lymphocytes. To compare the suppressive effects between plasma from cancer patients and human cord plasma, we investigated the PHA responses of lymphocytes which were sampled from patients with various stages of cervical cancer and cancer free women, by adding cancer auto plasma, human cord plasma and control plasma. The PHA responses of normal lymphocytes cultured with plasma from patients with 2nd and advanced stage of cancer were suppressed, but they were not suppressed by the plasma from O I stage of cancer. The addition of control plasma enhanced PHA responses of lymphocytes of the 2nd and advanced stage of cancer, but no changes were observed in the lymphocytes from O I stage of cancer. These results suggest that inhibitory factor does not appear in the plasma from the patients with O I stage of cervical cancer. Human cord plasma moderately suppressed the PHA responses of normal lymphocytes; it also suppressed the PHA responses of lymphocytes from O I stage of cancer. However, the PHA responses of lymphocytes from 2nd and advanced stage of cancer were improved significantly. Cord plasma may have a factor which promotes the PHA responses of lymphocytes from advanced cancer.
