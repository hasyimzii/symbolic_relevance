Carbohydrate infusion in internal diseases. A comparative study of metabolically healthy persons and liver disease and diabetic patients. IV. Infusion of a glucose fructose mixture (1:1 ratio) over a 48 hour period.
6 patients with liver cirrhosis, 6 patients with diabetes and 6 control persons were infused for 48 h with a mixed carbohydrate solution (glucose/fructose, 1:1). The infusion rate was supposed to be 0,25 g carbohydrates/kg and hour. The metabolical status was surveilled by 39 different laboratory values. The results showed that compared to a pure glucose solution blood glucose levels where decreased. Basic blood glucose levels were passed only in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, the glucose values were not as much elevated that permanent insulin administration would have been necessary. The antilipolytic, antiketogenic and anticatabolic efficacy was comparable to an equicaloric glucose infusion.
