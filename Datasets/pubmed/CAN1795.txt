Inhibition of B lymphocyte clonal proliferation by spleen cells from plasmacytoma bearing mice.
This study demonstrated that spleen cells of inbred BALB/c mice with plasmacytomas inhibited proliferation of the B lymphocyte colony forming cells that were precursors of immunoglobulin producing cells. The number of B lymphocyte colonies/10(5) nucleated spleen cells was depressed in mice with plasmacytomas. The degree of suppression correlated with the size of the tumor. Spleen cells from tumor bearing mice suppressed the formation of B lymphocyte colonies by normal BALB/c spleen cells. Treatment of the myeloma spleen cell suspensions with anti immunoglobulins, anti theta, or 1,500 rads did not prevent the suppression. Spleen cells from tumor bearing mice depleted of adherent cells by passage over Sephadex G 10 columns or adherence to plastic dishes did not retain their suppressive activity. Adherent spleen cells inhibited B lymphocyte colony formation when they were either in direct contact with normal spleen cells or separated from them by a layer of agar. These studies suggested that the immune suppression seen in plasmacytoma bearing mice occurred partially at the level of the B lymphocyte progenitor cell and that this suppression was mediated by an adherent mononuclear cell.
