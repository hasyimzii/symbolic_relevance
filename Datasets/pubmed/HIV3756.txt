Detection of surface and cytoplasmic CD4 on blood monocytes from normal and HIV 1 infected individuals.
CD4 on blood monocytes is generally regarded as being found on a subset of blood  monocytes. However, our results show that all monocytes are CD4+ but the number of molecules per cell is lower than T cells. We have performed immunofluorescent (flow cytometry, microscopy) analysis of monocytes from normal donors and HIV 1 infected patients using anti CD4 (Leu 3a) and the monocyte specific marker anti CD14 (Leu M3) monoclonal antibodies. Specifically: (1) 91% of monocytes from normal individuals show dual positivity for CD14 and CD4 (n = 14) as measured by flow cytometry; (2) 76% of monocytes expressed surface bound CD4 and CD14 when an enhanced two colour immunofluorescence microscopic technique was employed; (3) all CD14+ monocytes stained with an intensity of 3+( )4+ for cytoplasmic CD4. Few monocytes were CD14  and CD4+. Cell surface CD4 expression was blocked with unconjugated anti CD4 prior to staining; (4) the staining intensity for cytoplasmic CD4 in T cells was negligible; (5) CD4 expression on monocytes obtained from patients was as observed with normal individuals. The conclusion drawn is that all monocytes are CD4+ and the CD4 expression in monocytes is mainly cytoplasmic. Thus, all monocytes are potentially infectable with HIV 1.
