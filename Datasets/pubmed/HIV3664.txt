Possibilities for saving homologous blood in heart surgery.
The risks of blood transfusion in context with the increasing number of operative open heart procedures and the linked increased demand for blood products present a challenge to find methods of saving homologous blood. On the one hand there is increasingly less blood at the surgeon's disposal and on the other hand there is the threat of infectious complications with viruses of the HIV or the hepatitis group, as well as allergic reactions. At present we are developing the concept of blood saving as a programme which should work without excess demands on the staff and which can be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. The programme consists of the following components: preoperative self donation, use of cell saver, acceptance of e relatively low hematocrit, medication to alter the coagulation process and blood less priming.
