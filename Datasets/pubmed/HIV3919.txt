Immune activation and decreased tryptophan in patients with HIV 1 infection.
We compared tryptophan, neopterin, and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 22 patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) infection. Tryptophan levels were found to be decreased in CSF and serum of patients whereas neopterin levels in CSF and serum and serum IFN gamma concentrations were increased compared to healthy HIV 1 seronegatives. Tryptophan concentrations correlated negatively to neopterin concentrations, and serum neopterin concentrations correlated positively to IFN gamma concentrations. Thus, decrease of tryptophan levels is associated with chronic immune stimulation in patients with HIV 1 infection. From the data it appears that reduced tryptophan in patients may result from induction of indoleamine (2,3) dioxygenase by IFN gamma.
