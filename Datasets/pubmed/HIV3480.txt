HIV in sperm.
HIV in the semen is located in the mononuclear cell fraction, which contains CD4  lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, i.e. the classic HIV host cells. In addition, HIV is also present in cell free seminal fluid. The results on HIV binding to spermatozoa are still controversial. Genital tract infections are a possible cofactor that might increase the risk of HIV transmission by way of the semen, because they lead to a marked increase in the number of potential HIV host cells in semen.
