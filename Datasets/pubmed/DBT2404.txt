Systolic and diastolic time intervals in young diabetics.
Systolic and diastolic time intervals were used to examine left ventricular performance in 22 young diabetic men (mean age 25 years) with no apparent clinical heart disease. Pre ejection period index (PEPI), left ventricular ejection time index (LVETI), electromechanical systole index (QS2I), PEP to LVET ratio, the a wave percentage amplitude of the apexcardiogram (a/H5 ratio), the rapid filling wave (RFW), and the A2O interval were obtained in the conventional manner in 22 diabetics and 22 healthy men. The heart rate, diastolic pressure, PEP/LVET ratio, a/H per cent ratio, and A2O interval were significantly increased and LVET decreased in the diabetic group. QS2I, PEPI, and RFW did not differ from that in the normal group. Twenty three per cent of patients had an abnormal systolic time interval, 54 percent an abnormal diastolic time interval, and 23 per cent had both abnormal intervals. Though these studies provide no difinite evidence of a cause, the abnormalities found may reflect a subclinical diabetic cardiopathy.
