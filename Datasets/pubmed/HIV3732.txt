Condom use and acceptance: a survey of male Zimbabweans.
In addition to their traditional contraceptive role, condoms have moved to a crucial and central position in the strategy for prevention of sexual transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). As a cure for AIDS remains out of sight, condom use, celibacy and extensive health education remain the immediate sole weapons for controlling HIV infection. A stratified cluster sampling design of 722 Zimbabwean men reported 35.7 percent ever use of condoms while only 4.9 percent reported current condom use. 32.4 percent had unprompted knowledge of condom use for contraception. Circumstances during which condoms were used are discussed. Asked if the men would use condoms if asked by either wife or partner, only 30.0 percent of men who had not previously used condoms indicated that they would. Reasons given by the 64 percent with no previous use of condoms are discussed. Health education to promote acceptance and use of condoms is proposed.
