A new second generation anti HIV 1 enzyme immunoassay using recombinant envelope  and core proteins.
In a multicenter collaborative study a new second generation HIV 1 antibody enzyme immunoassay (Abbott recombinant HIV 1 EIA) using Escherichia coli expressed recombinant p24 and p41 proteins as solid phase antigens was compared with the first generation H9 cell line based Abbott HIV 1 EIA. The results of the confirmatory assays (Western blot, immunofluorescence), combined with clinical information, were used as the reference standard for the detection of HIV 1 antibodies in 10,676 random blood donor serum specimens, in a panel of 840 specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and a total of 63 serial blood specimens from 23 people at risk. With fresh blood donor sera, the specificity of the first generation assay ranged between 99.54 and 99.76% (95% confidence limits, CL) compared with 99.81 99.95% (95% CL) for the second generation EIA. With panel specimens the recombinant HIV 1 EIA achieved an overall sensitivity of 100% and a specificity range of 98.3 99.7% (95% CL); the corresponding sensitivity and specificity ranges observed for the first generation EIA were 98.0 99.5% (95% CL) and 94.3 96.8% (95% CL), respectively. The improved sensitivity for the second generation assay was confirmed by testing serial samples from seroconverting patients. The use of recombinant proteins eliminated non specific reactions due to class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) directed antibodies.
