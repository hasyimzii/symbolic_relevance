Cued recall in amnesia.
Use of a search procedure to control processing during learning results in apparently normal cued recall by some amnesic patients with impaired free recall learning. This suggests that their ability to encode and retrieve may be relatively intact when they are induced to carry out effective processing during learning. When processing is controlled during learning, cued recall should be useful for neuropsychological evaluation of residual learning and memory capacity.
