Primary carcinoma of the female urethra.
Experience in the diagnosis and management of 39 female patients with primary carcinoma of the urethra is described. The condition presents to both gynaecological and urological units and has a relatively good prognosis provided that it is diagnosed quickly. There must be, however, a clinical awareness of the condition in those patients presenting with non specific urological symptoms. Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice using interstitial implants for the superficial tumours and external beam for the deeper tumours. Surgery alone is possible in only a small number of cases, it being reserved mainly for recurrent or resistant disease.
