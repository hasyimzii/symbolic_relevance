Perioperative management of patients with pituitary microadenoma.
A systematic method for the perioperative management of routine cases of pituitary microadenoma treated by transsphenoidal microsurgery is presented. These methods have evolved over a 7 year period and have been utilized in the management of more than 750 patients with pituitary tumors and related problems treated by trans sphenoidal surgery. The goals in this joint neurosurgical, endocrinological, and otorhinolaryngological team effort are to eliminate errors in patient management, to assure the safety of the patient in the perioperative period, and to make the therapy as efficient and as cost effective as possible.
