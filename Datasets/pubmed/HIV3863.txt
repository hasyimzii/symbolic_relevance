The viral envelope gene is involved in macrophage tropism of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain isolated from brain tissue.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) strains isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) may represent a subgroup that displays a host cell tropism different from those isolated from peripheral blood and lymph nodes. One CNS derived isolate, HIV 1SF128A, which can be propagated efficiently in primary macrophage culture but not in any T cell lines, was molecularly cloned and characterized. Recombinant viruses between HIV 1SF128A and the peripheral blood isolate HIV 1SF2 were generated in order to map the viral gene(s) responsible for the macrophage tropism. The env gene sequences of the two isolates are about 91.1% homologous, with variations scattered mainly in the hypervariable regions of gp120. Recombinant viruses that have acquired the HIV 1SF128A env gene display HIV 1SF128A tropism for macrophages. Furthermore, the gp120 variable domains, V1, V2, V4, and V5, the CD4 binding domain, and the gp41 fusion domain are not directly involved in determining macrophage tropism.
