Second laparotomy in cancers of the ovary treated with chemotherapy. 17 cases (author's transl).
Seventeen cases of stage III and IV cancer of the ovary with widespread, non removable lesions were treated with 6 courses of combined chemotherapy including cis diaminedichloroplatinum, and this was followed by a "second look" laparotomy. Complete remission was obtained in 4 cases by chemotherapy alone and in 9 cases by chemotherapy and second surgical operation. The remissions have been maintained under new courses of chemotherapy, suggesting that a number of patients can recover from stage III and IV cancers of the ovary.
