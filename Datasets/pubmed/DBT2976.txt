Plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol in streptozotocin diabetic and non diabetic mice after prolonged administration of glibenclamide, chlorpropamide and metformin.
A possible influence of oral hypoglycaemic drugs on plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL C) concentrations was examined in streptozotocin diabetic and non diabetic mice. Treatment of streptozotocin diabetic mice with glibenclamide (0.4 mg/kg/day), chlorpropamide (10 mg/kg/day) or metformin (60 mg/kg/day) for 28 weeks did not significantly alter plasma total cholesterol (TC) or HDL C in streptozotocin diabetic mice. Plasma TC and HDL C were not related to the prevailing plasma glucose concentration. Non diabetic mice treated with glibenclamide or metformin for 46 weeks showed no changes in TC or HDL C. However, chlorpropamide increased TC and HDL C, and lowered the TC : HDL C molar ration after 46 weeks in non diabetic mice. The effect of chlorpropamide was associated with an excessive gain in weight.
