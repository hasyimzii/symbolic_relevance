Pantoyl gamma aminobutyric acid facilitates cholinergic function in the central nervous system.
Pantoyl gamma aminobutyric acid (P GABA) administered i.p. inhibited scopolamine  and atropine induced locomotor activities in mice, but did not inhibit methamphetamine  and apomorphine induced locomotor activities. In radiolabeled ligand binding experiments, P GABA did not inhibit the bindings of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, [3H]spiroperidol and [3H]apomorphine to rat brain membranes, but inhibited that of [3H]muscimol. GABA and P GABA enhanced K+ (25 mM) induced release of [3H]acetylcholine from slices of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus dose dependently, and their effects were antagonized by bicuculline but not by tetrodotoxin. These results suggest that P GABA binds to GABA receptors causing enhanced cholinergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The results are discussed in relation to the clinical use of P GABA in treatment of Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
