Structure activity relationships in the development of hypoxic cell radiosensitizers. III. Effects of basic substituents in nitroimidazole sidechains.
The effects of substituting 2 nitroimidazoles with groups carrying basic functions were studied. Prototropic, redox, lipophilicity and protein binding properties were compared with the efficiency in radiosensitizing hypoxic Chinese hamster V79 379A cells in vitro and the cytotoxicities of the compounds after chronic aerobic exposure. Seventeen compounds were (2 nitro 1 imidazolyl)alkylamines in which the effects of changes in the terminating base and of alkyl chain length were investigated. About an order of magnitude increase in sensitization efficiency could be observed in some compounds without any increase in the aerobic cytotoxicity compared to simple, uncharged 2 nitroimidazoles such as misonidazole. The behaviour of five hydrazones was similar to that of uncharged analogues. The methiodide quaternary salts of two of the (2 nitro 1 imidazolyl)alkylamines showed that quaternization considerably reduced sensitization efficiency. (Nitro 1 imidazolyl)alkylamines appear worthy of further investigation as hypoxic cell radiosensitizers in vivo.
