Effect of experimental diabetes on estradiol binding by the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus in ovariectomized rats.
In diabetic rats, 3H estradiol binding by the cytosol and nuclei of the anterior  pituitary was lower than normal. Changes in affinity and receptor numbers were demonstrated by Scatchard analysis. Protein synthesis in diabetic pituitaries, however, was in the normal range.
