Opportunistic infections and Kaposi's sarcoma among Haitians: evidence of a new acquired immunodeficiency state.
Twenty Haitian patients, hospitalized from 1 April 1980 to 20 June 1982, had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, central nervous system toxoplasmosis, esophageal candidiasis, cryptococcosis, disseminated cytomegalovirus, progressive herpes simplex virus, chronic enteric coccidiosis, or invasive Kaposi's sarcoma. Ten patients died. Opportunistic infections were frequently multiple and were recurrent in three patients. In seven patients disseminated tuberculosis preceded the other infections by 2 to 15 months. There was no evidence of an underlying immunosuppressive disease, and no history of homosexuality or intravenous drug abuse. At least three patients probably acquired the syndrome in Haiti. Lymphadenopathy was common. Seventeen patients tested had anergy, and 18 had lymphopenia. Monoclonal antibody analysis of peripheral blood T cell subsets done on 11 patients showed a marked decrease in T helper cells and an inversion of the normal ratio of T helper cells to T suppressor cells. This syndrome among heterosexual Haitians is strikingly similar to the syndrome of immunodeficiency described recently among American homosexuals.
