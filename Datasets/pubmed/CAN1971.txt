Capillary embolization. Part I: occlusion of the entire arterial system of the rat kidney (author's transl).
Effect of tumor embolization is limited by parasitary blood supply. The influence of those collaterals should be decreased by transporting the embolization medium into the capillaries and tumor sinusoids. Controlled and safe capillary embolization is developed from studies of obtainable radiodensity, viscosity, and occlusion mechanism of Gelfoam powder, IBC, and Ethibloc. The efficiency of these substances is compared to simple arterial ligation in experimental series with 400 Wistar rats. It is shown that ligation is comparable to insufficient capillary transport of the medium leaving islands of microscopically intact parenchyma. Easy application and total necrosis is guaranteed only by Ethibloc. Success of embolization is strictly volume dependent. Preinjected glucose is mandatory for homogenous distribution and peripheral transport.
