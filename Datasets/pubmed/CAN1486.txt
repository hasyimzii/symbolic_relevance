Mycosis fungoides associated with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease: a case report.
The possibility of the transformation of mycosis fungoides into a lymphoma of another histologic type is problematic. Convincingly illustrated examples are not to be found in the literature. We report on a well documented case of a man who developed nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease 15 years after first presenting with mycosis fungoides.
