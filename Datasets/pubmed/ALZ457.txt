Retrograde amnesia in Parkinson's disease.
Retrograde amnesia was assessed in demented and non demented Parkinson's patients using a test of remote memory spanning the years from 1920 1979. Results indicated that the demented patients 1) scored significantly below normal controls and 2) had equal impairment for all time periods. This pattern was like that seen in other dementing illnesses (i.e., Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases), but different from that in amnesic disorders, such as Korsakoff's syndrome. The data, therefore, suggest qualitative differences in pattern of remote memory loss between the dementias and amnesic syndromes.
