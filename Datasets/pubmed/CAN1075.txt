The lack of relationship between estrogen receptor status and response to chemotherapy.
The possible relationship between estrogen receptors and response of breast cancer patients to chemotherapy was examined in two situations: patients with advanced disease and patients receiving post surgical adjuvant treatment. In 73 patients with disseminated disease, no relationship between ER status and response to cytotoxic chemotherapy was observed. At this time, 44 of these cases have undergone extramural review; in these 44 cases, we observed no significant relationship between ER status and response to chemotherapy. In a series of 52 patients receiving adjuvant therapy, 27 patients were classified as failures due to recurrence. ER status did not offer prognostic value for failure of patients treated with postsurgical adjuvant therapy. We conclude that the prognostic value of ER data in nonhormonal therapy settings remains to be proven
