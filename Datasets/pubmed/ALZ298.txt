Somatostatinergic neurites in senile plaques of aged non human primates.
Using a polyclonal antibody directed against somatostatin, normal somatostatin positive neurons and fibers were seen in the amygdala and periamygdaloid cortex of both young and aged macaques. In addition, immunoreactive structures, identical in appearance to neurites demonstrated by silver impregnation methods, were seen in the amygdala of one aged monkey that exhibited numerous senile plaques. Some of these immunoreactive neurites were associated with deposits of amyloid, as seen with thioflavin T stains, suggesting that these were neurites of senile plaques. This study provides direct evidence for abnormalities in peptidergic neurons in brains of aged non human primates.
