Anti HIV screening of pregnant women in south eastern Norway.
Routine anti HIV screening of 36,053 sera from pregnant women in South Eastern Norway yielded four (0.011%) true positive individuals. Three of these were known to be HIV infected before pregnancy. In addition 23 women (0.064%) gave false positive results. Fifty (0.14%) women actively refused anti HIV test. Anonymous testing of the sera from these women probably yielded one single true anti HIV positive (2%). The prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant Norwegian women is very low. Nevertheless, this screening programme could be instrumental in the future for the indirect monitoring of the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection among the sexually active section of the population. False positive results were rare and caused no real diagnostic problem.
