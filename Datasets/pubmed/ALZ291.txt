Neuropsychological study of decline of attention and drug therapy of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
The present study provided a neuropsychological assessment of impaired attention  in Alzheimer's patients (57 89 years of age). Three control groups were evaluated: young normals (ages 18 32 years of age), an older group (55 69 years of age), and an elderly group (70 85 years of age). Alzheimer's patients showed an absence of CNV rebound and impairment in attention performance. They also showed significantly less facilitation in speed of response by a preparatory signal than the non patient groups. These findings suggested a possible discontinuity between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, a comparison of young, normal elderly, and Alzheimer's groups indicated a pattern of systematic decrease in CNV rebound, lowered short term memory performance, and slowing of reaction time during divided attention, a finding that suggests normal aging and senile dementia to represent quantitative differences on a continuum of gradual age related deterioration. Alzheimer's patients showed elevated levels of basal heart rate and eyeblink rate and increased oculomotor responsiveness in divided attention conditions. This finding was interpreted as compelling evidence against the concept of hypoactivity in senile dementia and as support for a distraction arousal interpretation of impaired attention in Alzheimer's patients, although decreased basal myogenic activity and lowered heart rate levels during divided attention in the patients indicated selectively dampened psycho physiological functioning. Distraction arousal processes appeared to be curtailed in the patient group after Hydergine treatment.
