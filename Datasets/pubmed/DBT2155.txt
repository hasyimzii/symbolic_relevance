Open angle glaucoma risk factors applied to clinical area.
In performing routine eye examinations, practitioners tend to provide essentially the same tests to all patients. For glaucoma detection, tonometry and ophthalmoscopy are routinely provided to adults over age 35, although characteristic visual field loss is considered the most definitive diagnostic clinical finding by most authorities. Since not all adults are at equal risk, glaucoma detection protocols should vary with patient risk and should include periodic perimetry. An understanding of the current information of risk factors for open angle glaucoma is essential in this regard.
