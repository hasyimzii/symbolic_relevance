Influence of insulinfree rehydration on diabetic derangements (author's transl).
In two groups of pts with diabetic derangements the effect of infusion therapy was investigated with regard to metabolic and endocrine functions. The rate of infusion was adapted to the height of the central venous pressure and the administration of electrolytes to their serum concentration. Insulin was withheld until no further decrease of blood glucose was noted. Group A consisted of 8 pts with severe diabetic ketoacidosis (blood glucose higher than 25 mmol/l, pH below 7.0 and/or bicarbonate below 10 mmol/l). The duration of insulinfree rehydration was 8.8 +/  1.3 (x +/  SE) hrs and the fluid retention 4060 +/  3 633 ml. The osmolality in serum decreased from 356 +/  12 to 340 +/  8 mosm/kg H2O and the blood glucose from 37.9 +/  2.9 to 28.6 +/  3.4 mmol/l. No correlation existed between the decrease of blood glucose and the expansion of the intravascular volume. Therefore, the decrease of blood glucose was not caused by a simple dilution effect. High renal glucose excreation was observed (408 +/  83 mmol) but could not explain the decrease of blood glucose. The glucose clearance fell from 25.9 +/  6.9 to 21.5 +/  3.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface from the first to the last 2 hr periods. It must be concluded that the initial rehydration deminished gluconeogeneses and/or increased tissue glucose utilization without exogenous insulin administration. This conclusion is supported by the decrease in the plasma concentration of the contrainsular hormons. Glucagon decreased 579 +/  209 to 319 +/  88 pg/ml (n.s.). Cortisol from 49.9 +/  4.6 to 35.8 +/  6.7 micrograms/100 ml (p < 0.05) and Adrenalin from 2.43 +/  1.03 to 0.4 +/  0.22 ng/ml (p < 0.05). Blood gas analysis revealed only minimal and ketobodies in serum no changes. Therefore, it can be concluded that rehydration and decrease of plasma concentration of contrainsular hormones do not influence the enhenced lipolyses in diabetic ketoacidosis. Group B consisted of 8 pts with nonacidotic diabetic derangements (blood glucose higher than 25 mmol/l, pH above 7.3 and/or bicarbonate above 18 mmol/l) and an acute weightloss of more than 3 kg. The insulinfree rehydration lasted 13 +/  1.6 hrs and the fluid retention was 4620 +/  380 ml. The serum osmolality decreased from 317 +/  5.3 to 288 +/  1.9 mmol/l. The decrease of blood glucose could not be explained by delution effect. The renal glucose excreation was 370 +/  120 mmol/l in total and the glucose clearance decreased from 15.3 +/  8.4 to 8.0 +/  2.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface (p < 0.01). Decrease of gluconeogenese and/or increase of glucose assimilation of the tissues can also be expected for the pts with nonacidotic diabetic derangements during plain rehydration.
