Angiodysplasia or vascular malformations of the cervical spine (author's transl).
Following exploration by angiography , 45 patients with cervical spine malformations ( out of 220 cervicocephalic examinations for vascular malformations), were treated by embolization. The 45 cases included 13 facial lesions, 4 pharyngolaryngeal lesions, 2 cervical venous ectasias, 4 arteriovenous fistulae of the vertebral artery, 19 medullary lesions, and 3 pseudomalformations (hemangiopericytomas). Though embolization is difficult it is of value in definitely vascular occlusions (follow up for 3 years), and miniaturization of catheters and balloon sounds enables very selective occlusion of vascular tumors or malformations to be carried out, micro emboli of 30 to 500 mu have been obtained.
