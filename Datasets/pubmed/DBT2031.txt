The lens influence on diabetic vitrectomy results. Report of a prospective randomized study.
Fifty cases with clear lenses that were undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy complications were randomly assigned to either retaining the lenses or to having lensectomy at the time of the vitrectomy. Management of the lens did not seem to have a major influence on the postoperative visual function. However, the aphakic cases had a higher incidence of elevated intraocular pressures and peripheral iris rubeosis at the six month follow up examination. The incidence of neovascular glaucoma was also higher in the aphakic group.
