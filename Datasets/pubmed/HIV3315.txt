Unexpectedly high levels of HIV 1 RNA and protein synthesis in a cytocidal infection.
The expression of a laboratory strain of HIV 1 (HTLV IIIB) has been studied in mitogen stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and in two lymphoid cell lines (CEM cells and C8166 cells). HIV expressing cells contained from 300,000 to 2,500,000 copies of viral RNA per cell. Near synchronous expression of an active infection could be achieved in C8166 cells. In these cells, the high copy numbers of viral RNA used as much as 40% of total protein synthesis for the production of viral gag protein, with high levels of viral RNA and protein synthesis preceding cell death by 2 to 4 days.
