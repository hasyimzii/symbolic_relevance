Predictors of falls among institutionalized women with Alzheimer's disease.
Falls among elderly residents are a major concern of facilities caring for the aged. A group of institutionalized women with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (N = 60; mean age 83) were studied longitudinally and evaluated annually on 21 variables of physical, social, emotional, self care, and cognitive functioning. A substudy of falls they experienced used data from two such annual evaluations. Clinical ratings by the interdisciplinary team estimated 1) the women's changes in function during the preceding year and 2) the current levels of the women's functioning. Separate regressions for each of the two years returned identical significant patterns indicating that ratings of physical vigor were significantly related to number of falls. Those women who had been among the most vigorous in the group but who had shown significant declines in the preceding year were the most vulnerable to falls; women who had been rated as the least vigorous but whose levels of vigor had been stable during the year tended to have fewer falls. Falling therefore appears to be related to the process of decline in vigor among those in the group whose levels of vigor were higher initially. There were corresponding significant declines in emotional and cognitive scales.
