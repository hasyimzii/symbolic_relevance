Functional analysis of the Tat trans activator of human immunodeficiency virus type 2.
The trans activator (Tat) proteins of the related but distinct type 1 and type 2  human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV 1 and HIV 2) display incomplete functional reciprocity. One possible explanation of this observation, suggested by computer analysis of potential RNA secondary structures within the viral trans activation response (TAR) elements, is that HIV 2 Tat requires the presentation of two viral RNA stem loop sequences for full activity whereas HIV 1 Tat is maximally active upon presentation of a single stem loop structure. Here, we demonstrate that the HIV 2 long terminal repeat indeed contains two functionally independent TAR elements. However, the second (3') TAR element of HIV 2 is significantly less active than the 5' TAR element and is functionally masked in the context of an intact HIV 2 long terminal repeat. Evidence is presented suggesting that the activities of these two HIV 2 TAR elements reflect, at least in part, their relative distances from the site of transcription initiation. Although the HIV 2 TAR element proximal to the viral mRNA cap site appears to be sufficient for effective trans activation by HIV 2 Tat in vitro, this functional redundancy may nevertheless serve to enhance HIV 2 replication in infected cells in vivo.
