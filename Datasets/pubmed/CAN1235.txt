Tumoral form of cerebral cysticercosis: diagnosis by computerized tomography.
Solitary granulomatous lesions due to cysticercosis in the brain were found by computed tomography in six patients. The CT images were in all cases very similar to those from brain neoplasms. The cerebrospinal fluid complement fixation test for cysticercosis was negative in all of the cases. The definite etiological diagnosis could only be made by craniotomy in this series.
