Leo insulins in the treatment of diabetes. Experiences from an internal medicine practice.
An account is given on the long term control of 27 unselected diabetics treated with Leo insulins in private internal medical practice. Both primary adjustments in recently manifested juvenile diabetes and change over from other insulins or oral antidiabetics were carried out as outpatient treatment. Thorough training of the patient, which is a prerequisite to successful cooperation between the diabetic and his physician, is just as important as regular metabolic check ups. The therapeutic results was considerably improved using Leo insulins. While 26 out of 27 patients were inadequately compensated before the beginning of therapy, the subsequent observation revealed very good adjustment in 11, good adjustment in 3 and satisfactory adjustment in 4 patients.
