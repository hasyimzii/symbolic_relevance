Transmission and genetic shift of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vivo.
HIVYU 6 and HIVYU 7 were isolated from an acquired immune deficiency syndrome patient (MK) and his asymptomatic sexual partner (MM), respectively. YU 6 readily infected not only peripheral lymphocytes from normal individuals but also human T cell lines such as H9, HUT 78, MOLT 4 and MT 4; YU 7, on the other hand, could not infect H9 and MT 4 cells. Furthermore, although autologous serum failed to neutralize YU 6, it was neutralized by the heterologous serum from the partner. Restriction endonuclease analysis of YU 6 demonstrated that it was a mixture of viruses. We have isolated two clones from YU 6 (YU 6 a and YU 6 b) by a plaque assay method and showed that YU 6 a had one more KpnI site than YU 6 b. It was also evident that YU 7 derived from YU 6 a, but had already shifted genetically from YU 6 a. Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus through heterosexual contact and a possible genetic shift of YU 6 a, b and YU 7 from a common progenitor virus in vivo is discussed.
