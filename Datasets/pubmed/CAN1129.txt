Adjuvant chemotherapy, antiestrogen therapy and immunotherapy for stage II breast cancer: 45 month follow up of a prospective, randomized clinical trial.
The results of adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF), endocrine therapy (t), and immunotherapy (BCG) in 318 women who had undergone mastectomy for Stage II breast cancer are reported after 45 months of life table analysis. CMFT therapy was found to be more effective than CMF alone in increasing recurrence free survival. This beneficial effect appears to be limited to patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors (ER+). Patients with estrogen receptor negative tumors (ER ) (< 3 fmol/mg) have increased recurrence rates and higher mortality.
