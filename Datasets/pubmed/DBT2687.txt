Application of the lod score method to detection of linkage between HLA and juvenile insulin dependent diabetes.
The lod score method has been applied to 28 informative families with at least one child suffering from juvenile insulin dependent diabetes (JIDD), assuming autosomal recessive inheritance, for detection of linkage between HLA and a susceptibility locus for this disease. These 28 families were pooled with 21 other families from the literature. The maximum lod scores were obtained for recombination fractions from 4 to 16%, according to the level of penetrance (10 to 90%). These high estimates of the recombination fraction are not in agreement with the hypothesis that the association between JIDD and specific HLA haplotypes is due to a simple linkage disequilibrium between the HLA region and a susceptibility locus for JIDD.
