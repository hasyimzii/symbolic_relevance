Hemoglobin A1c levels in children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus.
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured as an indicator of glucose control in 180 children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus who received two daily injections of insulin as part of a highly structured treatment program. A total of 426 HbA1c determinations was made in the group of 180 patients. HbA1c values were elevated in most patients despite the aggressive treatment. The HbA1c level was very elevated at diagnosis, fell to near normal after 60 90 days of insulin therapy, increased gradually, and reached a plateau after approximately 4 yr duration (at about twice the level in normal subjects) (mean +/  SEM, 10.0 +/  0.2% and 5.34 +/  0.07%, respectively). Mean insulin dose (U/kg/24 h) paralleled both HbA1c and duration of diabetes. The relationship between endogenous insulin secretion and glucose control was examined in those patients with diabetes for longer than 5 yr. Patients were separated into three groups based on HbA1c levels: those with HbA1c less than 9% (N = 22), between 9 and 11% (N = 26), and greater than 11% (N = 28). Serum C peptide and glucose concentrations were measured 2 h after a standard breakfast in those patients in the "low" and "high" HbA1c groups (mean HbA1c values 8.2% and 12.7%, respectively). C peptide was detectable in all patients and the mean C peptide levels did not differ significantly in the two groups, although postprandial glucose concentrations were significantly lower in the "low" HbA1c group (means +/  SEM, 96 +/  11 and 211 +/  21 mg/dl, respectively; P less than 0.001).
