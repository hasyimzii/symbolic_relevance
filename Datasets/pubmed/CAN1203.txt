Strategies used by patients with lateral telangiectatic naevi to handle their problems.
Considering the suitableness of operative therapies for remarkable skin defects without progrediency or malignity, we studied patients' feelings, cognitions and ways of acting with a special questionnaire. The forms were filled in by 28 patients with lateral telangiectatic naevi and a control group of 60 persons with normally constituted skin. The results did not show significant differences between the two groups. Therefore, the indications for surgery or radiotherapy have to be set up very cautiously.
