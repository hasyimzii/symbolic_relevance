Diabetic ketoacidosis. Reassessment of therapeutic "truths".
The diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis remains, as always, a bedside clinical exercise. Rapid consideration and exclusion of other conditions associated with altered consciousness that may occur in diabetics, such as lactic acidosis, hyperosmolar states, hypoglycemia, alcohol related ketosis, and infections, should be routine. Although recent reassessment of therapy has meant more rational and specific action, close attention to the physical and laboratory responses to treatment is equally essential for a successful outcome.
