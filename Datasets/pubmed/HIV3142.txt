Hepatitis B vaccination of 113 hemophiliacs: lower antibody response in anti LAV/HTLV III positive patients.
One hundred thirteen adults and children with hemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders were vaccinated against the hepatitis B virus. Each patient was given three subcutaneous injections of the vaccine at monthly intervals and then a fourth booster dose 14 months after the first. The vaccine was highly immunogenic, since 111 of 113 patients (98%) produced anti HBs (10 mIU/ml or more). After the first three vaccine doses and after the booster dose, ten anti LAV/HTLV III positive hemophiliacs produced anti HBs but had a lower average titer than anti LAV/HTLV III negative hemophiliacs. Of the 23 patients treated with concentrates in the 15 month postvaccination period only, none acquired HBV infection. Of the 50 patients treated with concentrates also in the 6 month prevaccination period, one developed hepatitis B. In summary, the vaccine was highly immunogenic in both children and adults with hemophilia; anti LAV/HTLV III positive patients responded to the vaccine, but the average anti HBs response was lower; no case of hepatitis B occurred in patients treated with concentrates only in the postvaccination period.
