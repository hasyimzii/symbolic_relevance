Use of THA in treatment of Alzheimer like dementia: pilot study in twelve patients.
THA, a centrally acting anticholinesterase, was given intravenously in varying doses to 12 unselected cases of Alzheimer like senile dementia. Significant improvement in memory testing occurred in 6 of 12 subjects; 9 of 12 improved in clinical staging. Analysis of results with respect to staging of dementia revealed that the degree of improvement was inversely related to the severity of dementia. Statistical analysis of these data by the Friedman test is detailed.
