Carcinoid tumor of the larynx.
A patient had a primary carcinoid tumor of the larynx. This is the second case reported in the American or British literature and the only one confirmed by a positive argyrophilic reaction and by the demonstration of neurosecretory type granules by electron microscopy. The patient's clinical course was similar to that seen in most cases of tracheal and bronchial carcinoids.
