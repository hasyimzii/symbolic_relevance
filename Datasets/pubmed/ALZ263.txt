Distribution of focal signs in a group of demented men.
The distribution of signs indicative of localized brain damage important in the diagnosis of multi infarct dementia (MD) has not been specified. The demented members of a longitudinally examined research panel (n = 519) were identified. Differential diagnosis of the probable causes of the dementias was made. Focal signs were found to occur in both the cases diagnosed as MID (n = 13) and the case diagnosed as senile dementia   Alzheimer's type (n = 27). It is important for the clinician in the evaluation of focal signs in dementing illness to consider the developmental sequence and the total clinical context of the disorder.
