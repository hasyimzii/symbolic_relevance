Appraisal of a new rapid enzyme strip.
The accuracy and reliability of new blood glucose measurement strips, BM Test Glycemie 20 800, were assessed in 99 consecutive patients attending the diabetic clinic and seven subjects at home. The BM Test Glycemie 20 800 strip technique was compared with the automated hexokinase method and the Reflotest Glucose test strip technique employing the Boehringer Reflomat. The mean of the blood glucose values was 12.6 +/  0.6 mmol/L for the hexokinase method and 12.9 +/  0.6 mmol/L for the 20 800 strip technique, with a mean difference between the hexokinase and the 20 800 strip methods of 1.9 +/  0.2 mmol/L. In the range 4 mmol/L to 12 mmol/L, the 20 800 strips were found to be extremely accurate, but for blood glucose levels less than 3.5 mmol/L and greater than 12 mmol/L, they were less reliable. Importantly, the strips were often misleading in indicating hypoglycaemia. It is concluded that the BM Test Glycemie 20 800 strips have a practical and valuable role when used by suitably instructed staff members, or by patients in the management of diabetes, and represent a major advance over urine testing on previously available direct reading enzyme strip methods.
