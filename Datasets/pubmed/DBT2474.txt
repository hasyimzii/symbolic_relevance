Perioperative stabilization of glucose levels in patients supported with total parenteral nutrition.
Fourteen nondiabetic and 6 diabetic patients were maintained on total parenteral  nutrition during major surgery. Glucose levels when compared to preoperative levels increased during and after surgery although there were no significant differences between the diabetic and nondiabetic groups. Serum sodium demonstrated a slight decrease and serum potassium a slight increase after surgery in both groups. Total parenteral nutrition can be maintained during surgery provided glucose and electrolyte levels are observed and appropriate insulin doses are administered to diabetic patients.
