Spin label and biochemical studies of erythrocyte membranes in Alzheimer's disease.
Electron spin resonance, enzymatic, and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic investigations of erythrocyte membranes from patients with Alzheimer's disease were performed. Alterations in the physical state of membrane proteins in Alzheimer's disease erythrocytes were found by spin labeling studies. However, no alterations in membrane lipid fluidity or in the activities of membrane bound sodium plus potassium stimulated, magnesium dependent adenosine triphosphatase or acetylcholinesterase could be demonstrated. Also, no changes in staining profiles of AD erythrocyte membrane proteins subjected to electrophoresis were observed. The altered conformation and/or organization of extraneural membrane proteins in Alzheimer's disease suggests the possibility that this disorder may have more widespread membrane involvement than was originally thought.
