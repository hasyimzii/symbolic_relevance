Isolation of a lentivirus from a macaque with lymphoma: comparison with HTLV III/LAV and other lentiviruses.
A retrovirus has been isolated on the human T cell line HuT 78 after cocultivation of a lymph node from a pig tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) that had died with malignant lymphoma in 1982 at the University of Washington primate center. This isolate, designated MnIV (WPRC 1) (M. nemestrina immunodeficiency virus, Washington Primate Research Center) shows the characteristic morphology of a lentivirus and replicates to high titers in various lymphocyte lines of human and primate origin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified MnIV revealed multiple bands of structural proteins, including a major viral gag protein of 28 kilodaltons, that did not comigrate with the viral proteins of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV [FRE 1]) that was also isolated on HuT 78 cells. The relatedness of MnIV to other lentiviruses (HTLV III/LAV, EIAV, and visna) was examined in radioimmunoassays, by immunoblot techniques, and by N terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the viral p28 gag protein. The immunoassays revealed cross reactivity only between MnIV p28 and HTLV III/LAV p24, and sequence analysis showed that 14 of the 24 N terminal residues of MnIV p28 and HTLV III/LAV p24 are identical. These results indicate that MnIV belongs to the same lentivirus family as HTLV III/LAV but is only partially related to these human acquired immune deficiency syndrome retroviruses.
