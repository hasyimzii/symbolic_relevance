Inhibitory effect of some intestinal bacteria on liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice.
Liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice was markedly promoted by association with a bacterial combination of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium paraputrificum. This study demonstrated that this promoting effect was suppressed by addition of certain intestinal bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Eubacterium rectale.
