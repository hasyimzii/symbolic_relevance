Atypical Alzheimer's disease with spastic paresis and ataxia.
An unusual case of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is reported. The patient was a 33 year old Japanese housewife who had progressive dementia, severe spasticity, and mild ataxia for six years. Postmortem examination revealed severe changes of AD and degeneration of the corticospinal tracts, as well as neuritic plaques and plaquelike degeneration in the cerebellum. This appears to be the twelfth reported case of AD with spasticity and ataxia.
