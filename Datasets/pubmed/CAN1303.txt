Breast masses in young women.
Based on our review we conclude the following concerning breast masses in young women under 30 years of age: (1) Breast masses are nearly always benign. (2) Mammograms are not helpful in most patients. (3) Needle aspiration or needle biopsy is rarely indicated. (4) Excisional biopsy should be performed through a circumareolar or other cosmetic incision. (5) Preparation for frozen section and mastectomy is not indicated. (6) the breast should be reconstructed in layers without drains. (7) Further manifestations of benign disease can be expected in 15 percent of the cases.
