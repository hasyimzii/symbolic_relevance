Evaluation of human and simian immunodeficiency virus plaque and neutralization assays.
A number of CD4+ T cell lines were compared for their ability to act as target cells for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in syncytium  and plaque forming assays. MT 4 and C8166 cells were the most sensitive indicator cells for HIV  and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) induced cytopathic effects, and gave rise to macroscopic (MT 4) and microscopic (C8166) plaques. The MT 4 plaque assay was evaluated for the measurement of HIV  and SIV neutralizing antibodies.
