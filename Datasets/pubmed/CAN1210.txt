Biochemistry of major human histocompatibility antigens.
The major histocompatibility region, designated HLA in man and H 2 in the mouse,  controls the expression of at least three groups of gene product   serum complement components and two sets of highly polymorphic cell surface antigens, the so called histocompatibility antigens. In this review Michael Owen and Michael Crumpton describe some recent insights into the biochemical structure of HLA antigens. CI    Copyright (c) 1980. Published by Elsevier B.V.
