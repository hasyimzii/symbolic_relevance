Impairment in T maze reinforced alternation performance following nucleus basalis magnocellularis lesions in rats.
Rats were trained on a reinforced alternation paradigm using an elevated T maze.  After pre surgical training subjects received either ibotenic acid (4 micrograms/0.4 microliter) or vehicle (pH 7.4, 0.4 microliter) bilaterally into the region of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis  an important source of neocortical acetylcholine projections. Acetylcholinesterase staining of sectioned brains revealed a loss of neocortical, but not hippocampal staining in lesioned animals. On the T maze task, lesioned rats showed significantly impaired choice performance relative to controls. They also demonstrated significant side biases, the degree of which was correlated with choice performance deficit.
