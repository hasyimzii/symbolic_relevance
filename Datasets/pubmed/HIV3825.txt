Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and cancrum oris (noma) in Ibadan, Nigeria.
This study analyzed 58 cases of necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG) and 5 cases of cancrum oris among children who sought treatment at the Ibadan University College Hospital, Dental Centre in a 1 year period. The peak occurrence of NUG was among 4  and 5 year old children and 84.5% of them were in the 2 to 7 years age range. Seventy two percent presented in the rainy season with positive history of recent febrile illness in 55 cases. There was no statistically significant association of NUG and rainy season. Possible predisposing factors in NUG and cancrum oris such as malnutrition, infectious childhood diseases, HIV infection, and immune compromise are discussed. It is suggested that children at risk should be advised to maintain good oral hygiene, adequate nutrition, and proper medical care.
