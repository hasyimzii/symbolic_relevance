Use of naphthylimidoacetic acid in experimental diabetes mellitus in rats.
Experiments were conducted on rats with prolonged (6 9 months) alloxan diabetes;  a study was made of the effect of naphthylimidoacetic acid (NIAA) on the blood glucose, fructose, cholesterol and sorbitol dehydrogenase level and also on the intensity of developing microangiopathies, according to biomicroscopy of the iris and electron microscopy of the muscle capillaries. Intramuscular injection of NIAA in a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight for 30 days failed to alter the blood sugar level, but there was a significant fall of the fructose, cholesterol, sorbitol dehydrogenase content; the intensity of microvascular affection was also considerably diminished.
