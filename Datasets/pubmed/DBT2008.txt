Soluble fibrin complexes and fibrinogen heterogeneity in diabetes mellitus.
The presence of soluble fibrin complexes (SFC) measured by gel filtration of plasma on 4% agarose columns, fibrinogen heterogeneity on 3.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels and the concentrations of several plasma proteins were evaluated in 39 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and 19 matched control subjects. A small but significant increase of SFC was found in DM (p less than 0.01). On individual basis 51.2% of the patients had increased SFC (greater than M + 2 SD of the controls). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the SFC showed no evidence of cross linking or proteolysis. Plasma clots formed in the presence of EDTA and trasylol were analysed in SDS polyacrylamide gels in a normal and two lower molecular weight fibrin bands (band I, II, III). The percentage of band I fibrinogen was in diabetics (65.3 +/  4.7%) lower than that of the controls (71.8 +/  4.5%) (p less than 0.01). Fibrinogen levels, antithrombin III, alpha 1 antitrypsin, alpha 2 macroglobulin and plasminogen were significantly increased in DM. We suggest that in DM there is an enhancement of intravascular fibrin formation and accelerated fibrinogen degradation to lower molecular weight forms.
