Neurochemical activities in human temporal lobe related to aging and Alzheimer type changes.
Activities relating to 3 neurotransmitter and 4 neuropeptide systems have been examined in human temporal lobe (post mortem) for their relationships with age and Alzheimer type changes (senile plaques and cognitive function). Significant alterations with increasing age (from 61 to 92 years) in a series of non demented cases included a reduction of the cholinergic enzyme, choline acetyltransferase, and an increase in vasoactive intestinal peptide immunoreactivity. In cases of alzheimer's disease the only neurochemical activity investigated which correlated significantly with cognitive impairment (assessed from a Mental Test Score obtained shortly before death) and with the severity of Alzheimer type abnormalities (senile plaques density) was choline acetyltransferase. Further analyses of the data in relation to the severity of plaque formation suggest that alterations in other neurochemical activities including reductions in dopamine beta hydroxylase activity, cholecystokinin octapeptide (aqueous extracted) and somatostatin immunoreactivities and an increase in substance P immunoreactivity, may occur at later stages of the disease process. These comparative data suggest that biochemical changes in this brain area associated with age and earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease may be relatively selective.
