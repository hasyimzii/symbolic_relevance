Highly specific inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by a novel 6 substituted acyclouridine derivative.
A novel 6 substituted acyclouridine derivative, 1 [(2 hydroxy ethoxy) methyl] 6 phenylthiothymine (HEPT), has proved to be a potent and selective inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) in vitro. HEPT inhibits HIV 1 replication in various T4 cell cultures as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages. The 50% antiviral effective concentration for HIV 1 (HTLV IIIB) in MT 4 cells is 7.0 microM, while the 50% cytotoxic concentration for mock infected MT 4 cells is 740 microM. Although HEPT is inhibitory to various strains of HIV 1, it has no effect on the replication of other retroviruses including HIV type 2. In contrast with the dideoxynucleoside (i.e. azidothymidine) 5' triphosphates, the triphosphate of HEPT does not interact with HIV 1 reverse transcriptase. The mechanism of action of HEPT remains subject of further study.
