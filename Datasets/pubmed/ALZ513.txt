Coexistence of acetylcholinesterase and somatostatin immunoreactivity in neurons  cultured from rat cerebrum.
Cultures derived from rat cerebral hemispheres were sequentially stained for acetylcholinesterase activity and for either somatostatin like immunoreactivity or cholecystokinin like immunoreactivity. Somatostatin like immunoreactivity was found to coexist with acetylcholinesterase activity in individual neurons of several morphological subtypes, but cholecystokinin like immunoreactivity and acetycholinesterase activity were never seen in the same neurons. These findings suggest a specific anatomical association, perhaps even an overlap, of the cholinergic and somatostatinergic systems in the mammalian cerebrum, and indicate that the combined deficiencies of somatostatin and cholinergic markers in Alzheimer's dementia and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type may be of pathophysiological importance.
