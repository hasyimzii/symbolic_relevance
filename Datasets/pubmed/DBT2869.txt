Multifocal deficits following "banal" concussion (author's transl).
This case seems worthy of attention for several reasons. To begin with, the process, which at first appeared to be concentrated in the orbital region, was triggered traumatically, with secondary glaucoma, lymphostasis and severe local pain in the left eye. Subsequently, diabetes insipidus developed, involving the hypophysis, while from the very beginning there was postchiasmatic hemianopia, later complemented by deafness and epileptiform attacks. All these complaints were most severe in the mornings, suggesting a vegetative disorder. Apart from the problem of interpreting the process the progression itself was remarkable, developing in the course of a few years from a "harmless" concussion to a complex cerebral syndrome, rendering the patient unfit for work.
