The value of whole lung tomography in the early detection of metastatic disease in patients with renal cell carcinoma and testicular tumors.
The value of whole lung tomography was compared to chest x rays in patients with  renal cell carcinoma and germ cell testicular tumors. We studied 83 patients with testicular tumors and 34 with renal cell carcinoma. At least 1 metastatic lesion was present on whole lung tomography in 11 of 64 patients (17 per cent) with testicular tumors and 2 of 21 (10 per cent) with renal cell carcinoma who had negative chest x rays. Of the patients with a solitary lesion on the chest x ray 3 of 10 (30 per cent) with testicular tumor and 5 of 11 (45 per cent) with renal cell carcinoma had multiple metastatic lesions on whole lung tomograms. Falsely positive chest x rays were noted in 6 of 15 patients (40 per cent) with renal cell carcinoma and 6 of 16 (37 per cent) with testis tumor. These falsely positive results were caused by overlapping shadows, vessels or granulomas.
