Glucose metabolism in the testis of the normal and streptozotocin diabetic rat.
In the present work, the metabolism of [U 14C]glucose was studied in the testicular tissue of normal and streptozotocin diabetic rats. The results show that diabetes alters 14CO2 production and 14C incorporation into lipids from [U 14C]glucose. No differences were found in the [14C]proteins and [14C]nucleic acids between experimental groups. Results are discussed in relation to an insulin deficiency and/or an alteration in the hypothalamic hypophyseal gonadal axis.
