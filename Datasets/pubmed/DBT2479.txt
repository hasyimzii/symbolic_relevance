Treatment of alloxan and streptozotocin diabetes in rats by intrafamiliar homo (allo) transplantation of neonatal pancreases.
A total of 116 adult male and female rats of own inbred F3 up to 8th generation weighing 180 350 g was rendered diabetic by a single i. v. injection of either alloxan (40 50 mg kg 1) or streptozotocin (50 60 mg kg 1) and 1  2 weeks later subjected to the intrafamiliar homo(allo)transplantation of 2  5 minced, collagenase non digested pancreases either from own newborns or from newborns of sisters and brothers of the same family under the renal capsule. Out of the total, 24 animals (20.68%) were successfully cured. The cured rats examined with the aid of intravenous glucose tolerance test (IV) GTT monthly for one year showed fasting normonoglycemia with increased postglucose values and decreased KG being in the range of latent, borderline diabetes. In male rats IV GTT deteriorated in nine months without any transition into manifest diabetes or loss of body weight. Some animals cured by transplantation reached a normal survival time and were able to bring forth litters and suckle their newborns. In the rats with complete reversal of diabetes the transplants with well developed, vascularized islets, consisting predominantly of B cells were found.
