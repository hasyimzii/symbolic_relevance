CSF acetylcholinesterase in dementia and in sequential samples of lumbar CSF.
Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity (nmol/ml/min) was measured in lumbar CSF from 11 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), 8 patients with Korsakoff psychosis and 33 patients with low back pain who were undergoing myelography (controls). There was no significant difference in enzyme activity between the three groups. There was no significant correlation between age and AchE activity. AchE was also measured in 20 two ml samples of CSF collected sequentially by lumbar puncture in two neurosurgical patients who had been recumbent for at least 8 hours. Variations in AchE between samples were small. In neither patient was there an increase in AchE activity with progressive sampling. These data indicate that (1) AchE is unchanged in Korsakoff psychosis (2) decreases in brain AchE which are found in DAT are not readily reflected in lumbar CSF (3) AchE in lumbar CSF has a diffuse origin including spinal cord (4) CSF AchE activity is unlikely to be a useful clinical marker for DAT.
