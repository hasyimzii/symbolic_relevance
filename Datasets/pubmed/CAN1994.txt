Management of liver cell adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia.
Since 1975 six cases with hepatic adenoma (5 females, 1 male) and five cases with focal nodular hyperplasia (3 females, 2 males) have been treated at our hospital. Four of the five women with hepatic adenoma took oral contraceptive pills before the diagnosis was made, only one patient took the pills in the group with focal nodular hyperplasia. Hepatic adenomas were resected electively in three patients; one patient underwent operation because of ruptureed adenoma with intraabdominal hemorrhage. In the other two cases with hepatic adenoma resections were not possible, but both tumors have regressed after the cessation of oral contraceptives. One patient in the group with focal nodular hyperplasia underwent liver resection because of intratumoral hemorrhage with recurrent pain; in the other four cases no treatment was done as symptoms were absent. We recommend elective resection for hepatic adenoma because of the high risk of spontaneous ruptur. Embolization or ligation of the hepatic artery are alternative procedures when resection is not possible and tumors do not regress after the cessation of oral contraceptives. On the other hand a more conservative attitude is suggested for focal nodular hyperplasia because those patients do not frequently bleed; resection is indicated in case of symptoms or growth of tumor.
