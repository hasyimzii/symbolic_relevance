Half of the patients had disseminated tuberculosis and the other half had localised disease with a high frequency of pulmonary setting. The most frequent symptoms were fever and constitutional syndrome (92% and 91%). The patient's chest X rays showed few cavitations and infiltrates and frequently had mediastinal and/or hilar (22%) lymphatic gland enlargement.
