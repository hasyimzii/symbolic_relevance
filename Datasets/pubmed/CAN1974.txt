Leukaemia reactivates mouse cytomegalovirus.
An established model for latency by mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) was used to assess the effects of leukaemia on reactivation of MCMV. After inoculation of 400 spleen focus forming units of Friend leukaemia virus (FLV), a significant number of mice yielded MCMV in salivary glands and kidneys 4 to 5 weeks later. Administration of cyclophosphamide during FLV infection increased the percentage of MCMV positive animals. These results suggest that cytomegalovirus infections in leukaemic patients may reactivate as a result of the leukaemia itself and may be exacerbated by chemotherapy.
