beta Cell residual function in juvenile diabetes mellitus (author's transl).
Estimation of C peptide (IRCP) can be used to measure the residual beta cell function in insulin treated diabetics. IRCP was estimated in 46 juvenile diabetics. A significant correlation between basal IRCP levels and duration of diabetes as well as daily insulin requirement could be shown. There was no linear correlation between glucosuria and IRCP. However, patients with IRCP > 1,0 ng/ml had significantly lower glucosuria ( p < 0,005). Endogenous residual function of the beta cells seems to be of importance for metabolic control in diabetic children.
