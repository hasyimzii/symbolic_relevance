Analogs of 3' amino 3' deoxyadenosine inhibit HIV 1 replication.
Several different nucleoside analogs have been demonstrated to inhibit retroviral RNA dependent DNA polymerase activity in preference to cellular DNA dependent DNA polymerases. 3' Amino derivatives of 3 deoxyadenosine was analyzed for their antiviral activity toward HIV 1 and for their host cell toxicity. Puromycin aminonucleoside (PANS), PANS 5' monophosphate, and 3' amino 3' deoxyadenosine triphosphate all inhibited HIV 1 replication in acutely infected cells. No significant antiviral effects of PANS were demonstrated in chronically infected cells. The effect of PANS was demonstrated at an early step in HIV 1 replication, most likely reverse transcription. 3' Aminonucleoside analogs are a novel class of inhibitors of HIV 1 replication that require further analysis in cell culture and animal studies.
