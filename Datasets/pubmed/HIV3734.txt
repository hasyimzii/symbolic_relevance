Liver damage caused by HIV infection.
Hepatic status was studied in 7 HIV infected patients at the stage of generalized lymphadenopathy. Intravital needle biopsy obtained from the livers characterizes the latter as enlarged, showing signs of protein synthesis dysfunction, morphological evidence of mild cytolysis, cholestasis, moderate mesenchymal inflammatory syndrome. The study of autopsy specimens obtained from hepatic tissue of the woman who had died of AIDS disclosed more advanced lesions: hepatocytes dystrophy, intralobular and periportal infiltration. The conclusion is made on the necessity of liver function examination entailing due therapeutic measures when following up patients with HIV infection and AIDS.
