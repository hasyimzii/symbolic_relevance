Non Hodgkin's lymphoma, HTLV III/LAV, and HTLV III/LAV antibody in the wife of a  man with transfusion acquired AIDS.
Non Hodgkin's lymphoma of the small intestine developed in a 66 year old woman who was the wife of a man with transfusion related acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Antibody to the human T lymphotrophic virus type III/lymphadenopathy associated virus (HTLV III/LAV) was present in her serum, and the virus was isolated from her peripheral lymphocytes. The possibility that the non Hodgkin's lymphoma in this patient was a manifestation of HTLV III/LAV infection is discussed. This is believed to be the first reported case of lymphoma occurring in a patient with documented HTLV III/LAV infection outside the male homosexual risk group.
