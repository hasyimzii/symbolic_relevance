Infection of human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV I) bearing MT 4 cells with HTLV III (AIDS virus): chronological studies of early events.
Early events in the infection of the human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV I) positive MT 4 cell line by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) retrovirus HTLV III were investigated. The virus was adsorbed completely to the cells within 60 min incubation after inoculation of the virus. Then, infected MT 4 cells started to produce the HTLV III specific antigens between 12 and 24 hr postinfection. Synthesis of the viral antigens consisting of 120K, 46K, 24K, and 17K polypeptides was suppressed by the treatment of the virus infected MT 4 cells with cytosine arabinoside (Ara C) or by the treatment of the virus with anti HTLV III positive sera. The progeny of the virus released from the infected MT 4 cells was titrated by a newly developed plaque forming assay method and reverse transcriptase activity. The maximum activity of HTLV III (3 X 10(5) PFU/ml) was observed on Days 4 and 5 p.i. Most of the viral activities in this preparation were ascribed to HTLV III, and not to HTLV I. No phenotypic mixing between HTLV III and HTLV I was discerned, although MT 4 cells were HTLV I producer cell line. Thus, HTLV III infected MT 4 cells are thought to be useful in further study of the interaction between host cells and the virus, and appear to be a good viral source for the analysis of the virus.
