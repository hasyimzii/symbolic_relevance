Mixed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in an individual: demonstration of both HIV type 1 and type 2 proviral sequences by using polymerase chain reaction.
Sera from persons seroreactive to both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) and type 2 (HIV 2), by whole virus (VEIA) enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for each virus, were selected from a seroprevalence study of 944 persons in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa, in 1987. These sera were subsequently tested for HIV 1 and HIV 2 antibody specificity by type specific peptide EIAs (PEIA) and western blot (WB) analysis for both viruses. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) from representative individuals were cultured in the presence of phytohemagglutinin stimulated normal donor PBMCs. These cultures were periodically monitored for HIV 1 and HIV 2 proviral sequences by using the selective DNA amplification technique polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As an outgrowth of this study, we report the case of a person dually reactive by various serological techniques in whom proviral sequences from HIV 1 and HIV 2 were detected by PCR. This is the first confirmed case of a mixed HIV 1 and HIV 2 infection in a single individual.
