The isolated thyroid nodule: notes on our personal experience.
An analysis of 255 patients operated for isolated thyroid nodes is made. Of these, 81% were cold nodes and 19% hot. Carcinomas were present in 21 cases. One carcinoma appeared as a scintigraphically hot node. The frequency of carcinomas, in relation to the nodules observed, was roughly the same in the two sexes. There is parallelism in behaviour of the rate in the two sexes as regards cold nodes, while this is not true for hot nodes. The importance of some recent diagnostic techniques is briefly discussed.
