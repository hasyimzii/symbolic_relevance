Sexual behavior in HIV antibody positive homosexual and bisexual men.
With the object of describing how their own health is experienced, the social circumstances and sexual behaviour in anti HIV positive homosexual and bisexual men, an anonymous questionnaire to be completed by the recipient was distributed in 1987 in connection with a placebo controlled investigation to assess the value of isoprinosin (Imunovir) in preventing the development of AIDS. 87% participated. Among the total of 85 participants, 78% considered that their health was good, 29% met family members and 75% friends at least once weekly. Fifty patients (65%) felt stressed in their daily lives which was definitely higher than in the normal population. All of the participants had altered their sexual behaviour in a manner which reduced the risk of HIV transmission but 18 (21%) had had sexual behaviour known to transmit HIV within the past year. This behaviour occurred more frequently in young persons (p = 0.09) and in smokers (p = 0.03). In addition, no connection could be demonstrated between a series of possible determinants for this, which may, however, be due to the limited extent of the material. It is demonstrated that awareness that one is infected with HIV does not eliminate dangerous sexual behaviour in all cases.
