Intrapericardial teratoma  neonatal cardiorespiratory distress amenable to surgery.
Intrapericardial teratoma in early infancy produces critically severe cardiorespiratory distress and often results in the death of the infant. A recent patient in our newborn nursery displayed the distinctive combination of cardiorespiratory distress and enlargement of the "cardiothymic" silhouette. The echocardiographic demonstration of pericardial effusion and cardiac displacement suggested the diagnosis. Our patient's mass received the early recognition necessary for a successful surgical outcome.
