Photometric determination of glycosylation of hemoglobin in diabetes mellitus.
We evaluated glycosylation of hemoglobin (HbA + HbA1) in 25 control subjects and  in 133 diabetic patients who were in various stages of blood glucose control, by measuring ketoamine linked hexoses in hemoglobin. These hexoses were converted by digestion with 10 mol/L acetic acid for 16 h at 100 +/  5 degrees C to 5 hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde, which was quantitated by reaction with 2 thiobarbituric acid. Glycosylation of hemoglobin was expressed as micromoles of hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde per gram of globin protein (the "HMF index"). A mean HMF index of 1.67 (SD = 0.23) was obtained for controls; that for diabetic patients was 2.93 (SD 0.95). The index correlated well (r = 0.83, p < 0.001) with average blood glucose concentration as measured during the preceding 16 weeks, over a wide range of glucose values (1 to 6 g/L). It correlated even better (r = 0.92, p < 0.001) when corrected for variations in hemoglobin concentration. Thus measurement of ketoamine linked hexoses of hemoglobin or HMF index provides an independent and useful alternative to the currently used methods that measure only HbA1 or HbA1c.
