Comparison of glucosuria in the first  and second voided specimens and the time of day as tested by four commercial testing products.
The questions addressed in this study were whether testing first  and second voided urine specimens yielded different results and whether selected commercial testing product (Clinitest 2 drop, Clinitest 5 drop, Tes Tape, and Keto Diastix) yielded similar estimates of glucosuria. Twenty adult diabetic experiencing glucosuria served as subjects. First  and second voided specimens were collected before meals and before retiring. Data were analyzed using a three way ANOVA with repeated measures on all factors. The findings indicated significant main effects for product type, F (3,57) = 7.61, p = .0004, and time of day, F (3,57) = 8.60, p = .0002. The main effect for first  and second voided specimens did not approach significance.
