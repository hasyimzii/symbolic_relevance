Computed tomography versus angiography in the localization of pheochromocytoma.
We report eight patients studied by computed tomography (CT) and arteriography and one patient studied by CT only and compare the value of both methods in the preoperative localization of pheochromocytoma. Single adrenal tumors were found in six adults (four were right sided and two were left sided). A 15 year old child had bilateral adrenal tumors, and a 12 year old child had a left adrenal tumor. An extraadrenal pheochromocytoma was found in another adult patient. Computed tomography demonstrated all but one tumor (a right adrenal lesion measuring 2.5 cm in the child with bilateral pheochromocytomas, both well shown by angiography). Arteriography, including subtraction films, demonstrated all but one tumor (an avascular extraadrenal pheochromocytoma measuring 4 x 8 cm well shown by CT). We believe that both CT and angiography contribute significant information in the preoperative evaluation of patients suspected of harboring a pheochromocytoma.
