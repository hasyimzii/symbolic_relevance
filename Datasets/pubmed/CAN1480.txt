Identification of somatomedin like polypeptides produced by mammary tumors of BALB/c mice.
A transplantable mammary tumor derived from an outgrowth of nodule like alveolar  lesions induced by 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene in cultures of whole mammary gland was shown to produce a family of somatomedin like polypeptides when cultured in vitro. Minced mammary tumor tissue as well as monolayer cultures of tumor cells produced similar polypeptides when incubated in serum  and hormone free medium. The polypeptides released into the medium ranged in molecular weight from 20,000 to 7,000 as determined by Sephadex G 50 chromatography under acidic conditions and analytical gel electrophoresis in acetic acid:urea. Because of their relative abundance, the M.W. 7000 polypeptides were partially purified and characterized. This preparation markedly stimulated DNA synthesis in chicken embryo fibroblast cultures and competed for the binding of 125I labeled multiplication stimulating activity to these cells. The binding of 125I labeled epidermal growth factor to the surface of mouse embryo fibroblasts, in contrast, was not affected.
