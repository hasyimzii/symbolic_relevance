A protocol for combined treatment of cancer of the oral cavity and tongue.
A protocol for combined treatment of carcinoma of the oral cavity and tongue as practiced at the Mason Clinic for the past five years is presented. This protocol combines surgery with postoperative radiation therapy, and the initial results are presented. Comparison of the results at this institution at the one, three, and five year level for tongue, oral, and pharyngeal cancer compared to other peer group reporting rates, as surveyed by the Commission on Cancer Audit of the American College of Surgeons, indicates that our results compare favorably to those of other institutions. Apparent increase in local control, a probable increased cure rate, together with marked decrease in hospital time and multiple staged procedures are noted. Disseminated distal metastasis has not been a major problem and is discussed.
