HTLV V: a new human retrovirus isolated in a Tac negative T cell lymphoma/leukemia.
A new human retrovirus was isolated from a continuous cell line derived from a patient with CD4+ Tac  cutaneous T cell lymphoma/leukemia. This virus is related to but distinct from human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus types I and II (HTLV I and HTLV II) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1). With the use of a fragment of provirus cloned from one patient with T cell leukemia, closely related sequences were found in DNA of the cell line and of tumor cells from seven other patients with the same disease; these sequences were only distantly related to HTLV I. The phenotype of the cells and the clinical course of the disease were clearly distinguishable from leukemia associated with HTLV I. All patients and the wife of one patient showed a weak serological cross reactivity with both HTLV I and HIV 1 antigens. None of the patients proved to be at any apparent risk for HIV 1 infection. The name proposed for this virus is HTLV V, and the date indicate that it may be a primary etiological factor in the major group of cutaneous T cell lymphomas/leukemias, including the sporadic lymphomas known as mycoses fungoides.
