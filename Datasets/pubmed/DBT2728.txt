Nesidioblastosis, islet cell hyperplasia, and adenomatosis in a case of metastasizing insulinoma: contribution to the genesis of the islets of Langerhans.
An unusual case of insulinoma is described in a 40 yr old woman whose resected pancreas showed multiple adenomas with lymph node metastasis, associated hyperplasia of islets, and nesidioblastosis. The association of nesidioblastosis with this continuum of proliferative changes adds further evidence for a ductular origin of islet cell tumors.
