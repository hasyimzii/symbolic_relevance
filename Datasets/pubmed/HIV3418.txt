HIV: epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, and clinical consequences.
HIV infection is a global problem, with the largest number of cases occurring in  the United States. HIV affects men, women, and children with varying frequency in different parts of the world. The spectrum of HIV infection and its consequences is broad. HIV, a retrovirus, is responsible for gradual and progressive damage to the human immune system. Over the course of years (more than 7 in many), the resultant deficiency in cell mediated immunity leaves the host susceptible to infections, malignancies, and possible neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Current efforts to better understand this virus, its interaction with the human immune system, its clinical consequences, and its detection will continue to bring us closer to finding effective means of preventing and treating HIV infection. In addition, an understanding of the epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, and clinical consequences of HIV infection will contribute to a more knowledgeable approach to caring for HIV infected individuals and anticipating their many needs.
