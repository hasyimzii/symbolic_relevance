Evaluation of neck masses.
This paper presents the general principles for evaluation of a neck mass. Included are a differential diagnosis according to patient age and location of the neck mass, and a differential diagnosis of neck masses related to the variety of anatomic structures found in the neck. Also included is a detailed discussion of the history and physical examination appropriate for evaluation of neck masses. Subsequently, the various tests which may be appropriately applied to the evaluation of neck masses are described. Neck masses require a thorough and thoughtful evaluation; a hasty decision for open biopsy is inadvisable. When any significant question regarding diagnosis and therapy arises, the patient should be referred to a competent head and neck specialist.
