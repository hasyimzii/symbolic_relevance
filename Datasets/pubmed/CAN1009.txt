Cefuroxime tobramycin treatment of bacterial infections in cancer patients.
Twenty five patients with different metastatic tumors, and often with other diseases which may have further compromised their defenses (such as diabetes, anemia and neutropenia), had a simultaneous bacterial complication. This was regarded as documented (i.e., proved by positive culture) in 12 of 25 patients, and probable if subjective and objective symptoms, X ray, laboratory tests and the clinical picture agreed with bacterial infection in progress, even though the culture was negative, in 13 of 25 patients. Antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime tobramycin gave good results in 19 of 25 patients, i.e., in 10 of 12 with a documented infection and in 9 of 13 with a probable infection. Fever of unknown origin and urinary infections were the most responsive to the therapy. Three of 25 patients had nephrotoxicity, with a very small rise in BUN and creatinine, which was easily reversible. According to our experience, antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime tobramycin would be useful in cancer patients with bacterial complications because of its effectiveness and tolerability.
