Prediction of sexual behaviour in a group of young Norwegian adults.
The purpose of the present study was to identify predictors of sexual promiscuity and use of condoms. The empirical data stem from a postal survey of a representative sample of persons aged 19 24 in a medium sized Norwegian town (n = 565). Four selected predictors explained 28.1% and 17.8% of the variance in promiscuity among men and women, respectively. The strongest predictors of sexual promiscuity of men were "la dolce vita" (i.e. alcohol consumption and visits to discoteque/cinema) and marital status. For women the strongest predictors of sexual promiscuity were marital status and age at first intercourse. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS had no significant effect upon either female nor male promiscuity. Six predictors, including promiscuity and knowledge of HIV/AIDS, did not explain a substantial proportion of the variance of condom use neither among men nor women. Age at first intercourse was the only significant predictor upon use of condoms for both men and women.
