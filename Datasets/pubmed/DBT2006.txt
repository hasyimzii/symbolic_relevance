The proteinuria of diabetic nephropathy.
The results of an investigation into the nature of the proteinuria of diabetic nephropathy are described. Proteinuria increases quantitatively with deteriorating renal function but there is no consistent qualitative change; even with small amounts of proteinuria the selectivity may be poor and the proportion of albumin to the total excretion constant. These and other findings are discussed in relation to the possible pathogenesis of the glomerular dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy.
