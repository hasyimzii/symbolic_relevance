Current issues in developing a strategy for dealing with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
A number of current issues exist that must be taken into account in the development of a strategy for dealing with the problem of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States and throughout the world. Given the complexity of the problem and the fact that the epidemic is still in its evolving stages, such issues must be considered individually and as a group. The present discussion focuses on several of these critical issues and outlines approaches that might be useful in the formulation of basic scientific and public health strategies for dealing with the currently appreciated and projected problems in AIDS.
