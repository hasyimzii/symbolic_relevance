Analysis of causes of CNS damages in neonates delivered by cesarean section (author's transl).
Of 27.978 newborns delivered at the University Hospital Department of Gynecology  and Obstetrics in Beogradu, from 1978 to 1980, 2218 (7.92%) were born by cesarean sections. Clinical biochemical and morphological elements of hypoxic and ischemic CNS lesions were found in 107 (4.82%) cases out of the infants born by cesarean section and in 1301 (5.05%) cases out of the infants born by vaginal delivery. The difference is not statistically significant. Investigations of the causes, i. e. risk factors of CNS lesions in infants born by cesarean section, in correlation with the control group consisting of 670 cesarean sections performed in 1980 without CNS lesions, have revealed: a) high risk factor (p less than 0.01) appeared to involve parity (para III and more), maternal diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, EPH gestosis), placenta praevia, premature rupture of the membranes, prematurity birth weight below 2500 g, and low Apgar score (1 7); b) significant risk factors (p less than 0.05) are some social factors (unemployed mothers and mothers from rural areas), duration of labor (more than 10 hours), transverse presentation, hydramnion, previous spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. The analysis has shown that CNS lesions in infants born by cesarean section may result from different factors; medical, biological, and social.
