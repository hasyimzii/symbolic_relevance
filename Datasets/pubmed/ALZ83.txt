Alzheimer disease: evidence for selective loss of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis.
The nucleus basalis of Meynert provides diffuse cholinergic input to the neocortex. When compared with an age  and sex matched control, the nucleus basalis from a patient with Alzheimer disease demonstrated substantial reduction of neurons. Loss of this neuronal population may represent an anatomical correlate of the well documented cholinergic derangement in Alzheimer disease.
