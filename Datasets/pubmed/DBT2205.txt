Glycosylated haemoglobin in children with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1) was measured serially by microcolumn chromatography in 38 children with newly diagnosed insulin dependent diabetes. Initial HbA1 levels of 13.6 +/  0.5% fell signficiantly from day 0 (prior to therapy) both to day 1 (1.6 +/  0.2% decrease) and to day 3 5 (2.6 +/  0.4% decrease) (P < 0.001). This drop correlated closely with changes in blood glucose (P < 0.001), less closely and inversely with plasma bicarbonate levels (P < 0.01), but not with prior duration of symptoms or changes in serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. HbA1 levels reached a nadir of 8.2 +/  0.3% 3 weeks to 6 months after diagnosis, and correlated with decreasing insulin dosage (P < 0.001). HbA1 levels rose again to 11.4 +/  0.5% in 21 patients followed for more than 3 6 months. Our results indicate that (1) HbA1 level change rapidly during initial stabilization of insulin dependent diabetes suggesting that glycosylation may not be entirely irreversible, and (2) HbA1 levels are consistent with clinical assessment of control during remission and postremission phases.
