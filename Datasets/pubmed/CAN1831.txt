Fibromyxoma of the mandible: case report and radiographic considerations.
A case of a 27 year old black woman with typical findings of a large, asymptomatic myxoma involving the entire left half of the mandible is presented. The lesion was treated by a partial mandibulectomy and secondary bone graft with a titanium tray and condyle prosthesis. A comparison of the patient's bitewing, periapical, and panoramic radiographs was made. The lesion was not visible on the bitewings and was overlooked on the periapical films, but was clearly visible on the panoramic radiograph. The screening value of this radiograph was stressed.
