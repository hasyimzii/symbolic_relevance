The role of vascularization in the formation of echographic patterns of hepatic metastases: microangiographic and echographic study.
An experimental microangiograhic and echographic study was carried out on metastatic autopsy livers which were also examined histologically. Relationships between the echographic pattern and vascularization are explored. In most cases, hypervascular lesions correspond to hyperechogenic patterns, while hypovascular lesions furnish hypoechogenic images.
