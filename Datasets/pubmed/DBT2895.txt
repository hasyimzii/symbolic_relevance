Late results of pars plana vitrectomy in diabetics (author's transl).
Report on 82 consecutive cases in which pars plana vitrectomy was performed because of intravitreal hemorrhage. Postoperative follow up ranged from 3 to 4 1/2 years. Although an incipient improvement of the visual acuity was achieved in 54%, recurrent hemorrhages as well as progression of the proliferative diabetic retinopathy lead to visual deterioration of blindness in 64% of the eyes.
