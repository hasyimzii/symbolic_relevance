Influence of vitamins of the B group upon cancer patients treated by irradiation: I. Vitamin B6 in local irradiation of tumour rats (author's transl).
Eleven hundred rats with tumours were administered vitamin B6 (pyridoxine or pyridoxal 5 phosphate) before a single local irradiation of 10 Gy. No difference in the survival rate was found in comparison with control animals. Thus vitamin B6 in the dose used afforded no significant protection against local radiation in rats. The 24 hour xanthurenic acid excretion in urine increased with growth of the tumor and was further elevated by local radiation (10 Gy). Radiation as well as the tumour itself induce in the rat metabolic changes typical of vitamin B6 deficiency.
