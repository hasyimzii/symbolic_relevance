Feedback in cancer.
The theory presented regards cancer as a systemic disease initiated by carcinogens, and neoplasia as the organism's main defence against it. Carcinogens are assumed to destroy a vital substance "A" which is replenished by a second, "B", produced by neoplastic stem cells. Cancer progression is manifested by a gradual deterioration of the "A" producing machinery accompanied by a compensatory proliferation of neoplastic "B" producing stem cells whose size is therefore closely regulated so as to meet the organism's demands. Any stem cell pool reduction leading to a loss of "A" or "B" is followed by a proliferation of the remaining stem cells to replenish the loss. Such may be observed in chronic lymphoblastic leukemia maintaining a nearly constant elevated peripheral lymphoblast count. Following selective lymphoblast destruction the count is rapidly replenished to its pretreatment level. The same mechanism is assumed to explain the detrimental effect of some surgical interventions on cancer patients. Neoplastic progression is postulated to a obey a "stem cell conservation" principle which when violated is followed either by a stem cell replenishment or aggrevates the patient's conditions. This conservation law introduces a new definition of carcinogenesis: Any process reducing the "A" or "B" producing machinery is regarded as a carcinogen. A definition embracing, surgical extirpation of normal or neoplastic stem cells or cell destruction by irradiation, chemotherapy or chemical carcinogens.
