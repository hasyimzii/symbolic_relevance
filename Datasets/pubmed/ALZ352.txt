Bitemporal hypometabolism in Creutzfeldt Jakob disease measured by positron emission tomography with 18F 2 fluorodeoxyglucose.
It is well established that Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) is caused by a slow infectious agent similar to the scrapie prion. However, the pathogenesis of this infection is poorly understood. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed on a 54 year old man with autopsy confirmed CJD using [18F] 2 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and the Donner 280 crystal tomograph. Temporal lobe hypometabolism with hemispheric asymmetry was observed. These findings are similar to those previously obtained in PET FDG studies of patients with clinically defined Alzheimer disease (AD). The similarities in the regional metabolic alterations between CJD and AD provide additional evidence for the possibility that AD may be caused by a slow infectious prion.
