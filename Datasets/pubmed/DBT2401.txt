Factors determining outcome of reversed saphenous vein femoropopliteal bypass grafts.
The investigation was designed to study factors that might be of predictive value in femoropopliteal vein bypass grafting. A series of 146 grafts had a cumulative 5 year graft patency of 82.5 per cent. Five year limb survival rate in salvage cases was 77.9 per cent. These results are encouraging. However, taking certain factors into account, the patency rates varied. In limbs with claudication, the 5 year graft patency rate was significantly higher than in salvage procedures (P < 0.05). Basal and maximal (during pharmacological vasodilatation) intraoperative graft flow rates were also significantly higher in claudicating limbs (P < 0.01). Reconstructions in limbs with a good run off had better patency and flow rates than in limbs with a poor run off (P < 0.001). This suggests that progression of distal atherosclerosis is a major factor for late graft thrombosis. The incidence of graft thrombosis was correlated with the flow rates (P < 0.01). Age, the presence of diabetes, graft diameter and the site of the distal anastomosis did not affect patency.
