Does HIV cause salivary gland disease?
HIV associated salivary gland disease (HIV SGD) is characterized by enlargement of the major salivary glands and/or xerostomia. HIV does not appear to play a direct role in this disease since it was detected by immunohistochemistry in only occasional lymphocytes in labial salivary glands in two out of six patients; it was not found in the salivary gland epithelial cells. Moreover, HIV was not found in any of 21 saliva samples from seven patients. We conclude that HIV SGD is not caused by direct infection of the salivary glands with HIV.
