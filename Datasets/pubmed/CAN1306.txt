Mortality of welders, shipfitters, and other metal trades workers in boilermakers Local No. 104, AFL CIO.
The mortality experience of 8679 members of a metal trades union  men employed in shipyards, metal fabrication shops, small boat yards, and field construction  was studied from 1950 to 1976 by the historical prospective method. Relative to rates for US men of comparable age and race, the risk of death from all causes combined was 0.99. However, excesses of 40 per cent (p < 0.001) and 60 per cent (p < 0.001) occurred for malignant and nonmalignant respiratory disease deaths, respectively, beginning 20 years after first employment. The mortality excesses from malignant and nonmalignant respiratory diseases increased with increasing interval from first employment; and the nonmalignant respiratory disease excess was also related to cumulative exposure. Causes of death that occurred at significantly (p < 0.05) greater than expected rates in specific job classifications included pneumonia in welders, accidents and suicide in shipfitters, and emphysema in burners.
