The activities of thymidine metabolising enzymes during the cell cycle of a human lymphocyte cell line LAZ 007 synchronised by centrifugal elutriation.
The activities throughout the cell cycle of thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21), dihydrothymine dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.2), thymidine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.4) and dTMP phosphatase (EC 3.3.3.35) were measured in the Epstein Barr virally transformed human B lymphocyte line LAZ 007. Cells were synchronised at different stages of the cell cycle using the technique of centrifugal elutriation. The degree of synchrony in each cycle stage cell population was determined by flow microfluorimetric analysis of DNA content and by measurement of thymidine incorporation into DNA. The activity of the anabolic enzyme thymidine kinase was low in the G1 phase cells, but increased manyfold during the S and G2 phases, reaching a maximum after the peak of DNA synthesis, then decreasing in late G2 + M phase. By contrast, the specific activities of the enzymes involved in thymidine and thymidylate catabolism, dihydrothymine dehydrogenase, thymidine phosphorylase and dTMP phosphatase remained essentially constant throughout the cell cycle, indicating that the fate of thymidine at different stages of the cell cycle is governed primarily by regulation of the level of the anabolic enzyme thymidine kinase and not by regulation of the levels of thymidine catabolising enzymes.
