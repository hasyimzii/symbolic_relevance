Gastric carcinoma in young people. A case report and review of the literature.
A 25 year old woman presented with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, a leucoerythroblastic peripheral blood picture and a benign appearing gastric ulcer. Bone marrow trephine biopsy revealed metastatic mucin producing adenocarcinoma and gastroscopy with biopsy confirmed a gastric primary. Combination chemotherapy provided temporary symptomatic improvement but the patient expired seven months later. A review of gastric carcinoma in patients less than 30 years old is given. Symptoms of peptic ulcer disease are common and radiographs may demonstrate benign appearing gastric ulcers. Carcinoma is infrequently suspected and delays in diagnosis may contribute to a poor prognosis.
