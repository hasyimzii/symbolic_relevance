Epitheliomas of the anterior margin of the larynx. A study of 102 cases (author's transl).
In this second part, we study 102 cases of epithelioma of the anterior margin of  the larynx. The authors insist on the need for bilateral treatment of lymphatic areas on account of their frequent bilateral involvement, jumping from 9% for N0 to 80% for a fixed unilateral enlarged lymph node. Whatever the T stage, the best therapeutic results are provided by total or partial surgery of the lesion combined with surgical treatment of lymphatic areas completed by irradiation.
