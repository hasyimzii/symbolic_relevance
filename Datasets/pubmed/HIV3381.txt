A strategy for educating health care providers about AIDS: the California Nurses  Association's AIDS Train the Trainer Program.
The AIDS epidemic is increasing the demand on all levels of health care staff to  provide care compassionately and safely to people with AIDS and HIV infection. Only appropriate, ongoing education of all health care workers will maintain an effective health care system as the number of cases rises. However, the fear engendered by the word AIDS can be a serious deterrent to effective care. Adult learning principles and fear reduction techniques provide the foundation for AIDS education. A train the trainer approach provides immediate AIDS expertise to health care providers within their institution or department. With adequate resources and training, health care professionals who are already in the workplace are in the best position to quell hysteria, educate health care workers about appropriate protective measures, and ensure that humane, compassionate care is provided to persons with AIDS and HIV infection.
