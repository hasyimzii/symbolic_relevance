Immunological tests and the diagnosis of dementia in elderly women.
Serum immunoglobulins and circulating antinuclear antibodies were assayed in 91 elderly female in patients with dementia. Clinical criteria were used to distinguish a group with multi infarct dementia from those with senile dementia of Alzheimer type and the results were compared with those of 19 age matched controls. Dementia patients aged 85 and over had a higher prevalence of antinuclear antibodies (P less than 0.05) and those aged 90 95 had higher levels of IgA than younger age groups (P less than 0.025). IgG levels were higher than controls in the 'multi infarct' group (P less than 0.025).
