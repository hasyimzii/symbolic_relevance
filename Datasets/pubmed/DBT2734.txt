A "new" primed lymphocyte typing (PLT) defined DP antigen associated with a private HLA  DR antigen.
We have recently described a "new" private HLA DR antigen, DR"LTM", which has a frequency of approximately 0.6% in Danes. Primed Lymphocyte Typing (PLT) cells directed towards DR"LTM" associated determinants were generated in vitro by haplotype primings in two unrelated families with DR"LTM" positive individuals. Both PLT cells reacted in parallel and gave positive reactions with (i) two unrelated and (ii) eight related individuals, all of whom were DR"LTM" positive. Both PLT cells gave negative reactions with (i) 38 unrelated and (ii) 15 related DR"LTM" negative individuals. Thus, there was total agreement between the results obtained by HLA DR typing with the antiserum "LTM" and by PLT typing with these two haplotype primed PLT cells. None of the DP"LTM" positive individuals carried more than one of the antigens HLA Dw/ DRw/DP1 8 and the local specificity D/DP"H". Accordingly, this "new" PLT defined antigen, DP"LTM", most probably belongs to the series of HLA D/DR associated DP antigens previously described.
