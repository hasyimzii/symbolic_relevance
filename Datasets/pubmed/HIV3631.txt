An antigenic peptide of the HIV 1 NEF protein recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes of seropositive individuals in association with different HLA B molecules.
By using target cells that expressed only the regulatory NEF protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we were able to identify specific cytolytic T cells (CTL) from most of the seropositive patients tested. This NEF specific cytolytic activity was mediated by CD8+ lymphocytes. In two different donors, we identified a unique peptide in the NEF protein that could be recognized in association with two different HLA class I molecules. The definition of such a peptide should prove useful in evaluating vaccine strategies.
