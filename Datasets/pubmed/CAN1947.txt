Behavior of plasminogen in prostatic carcinoma treated with cytonal.
With the help of the lysis time method after Blix as well as of the radial immune diffusion after Mancini in blood donors and in patients with histologically ascertained carcinoma of the prostate estimations of plasminogen were performed. In the group of patients the controls were repeated after having finished the initial therapy. While with the help of the two methods plasminogen values were established before therapy which essentially were within the normal, after the initial therapy with cytonal a significant increase of plasminogen developed. The importance of these findings is discussed in connection with a possible increased rate of fibrinolysis in carcinoma of the prostate.
