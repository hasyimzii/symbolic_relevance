On the question of endocrine side effects in patients on medication for renal calcium stone disease (author's transl).
In patients with recurrent idiopathic nephrolithiasis we studied whether treatment with sodium cellulose phosphate leading to decreased intestinal calcium absorption could induce secondary hyperparathyroidism and whether thiazides which diminish calciuria would impair glucose tolerance. After removal of a actual kidney stone, 74 patients were treated for one year as follows: 25 (group 1) received conventional therapy (Nieron), 22 (group 2) received sodium cellulose phosphate, and 27 (group 3) received sodium cellulose phosphate plus hydrochlorothiazide. The period of one year was too short to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regarding stone recurrence, however, a significant decrease in calciuria only was seen in group 3. With respect to the possibility to develop secondary hyperparathyroidism, group 2 and group 3 did not reveal any hints. In group 3, the thiazide treatment did not worsen glucose tolerance. Therefore, longer lasting studies with these drugs could be performed without evident danger to develop the mentioned side effects.
