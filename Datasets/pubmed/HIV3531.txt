AIDS: clinical and ethical issues on a psychiatric unit.
Using a case illustration, this paper describes how AIDS has affected psychiatric practice on an inpatient unit. The clinical, ethical and administrative issues are discussed from a multi disciplinary perspective. The issues are discussed as 1. clinical issues (diagnostic and management), 2. effects on ward milieu, 3. staff issues, 4. family counselling and discharge planning and 5. administrative issues. It is important for inpatient staff to discuss these issues and develop clinical guidelines and administrative procedures that will help staff provide the highest level of care possible. Because every patient is potentially an HIV carrier, many of the solutions developed around AIDS related concerns should apply to all patients on a psychiatric ward.
