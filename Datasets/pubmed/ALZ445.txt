Predictive features in mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
Forty three subjects with mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, diagnosed and staged by clinical research criteria, were studied with clinical, psychometric, EEG, visual evoked potential, and CT measures. During the 12 months following entry into the study, 21 subjects progressed to moderate or severe dementia, 21 remained mild, and one was lost to follow up. Many of the clinical and psychometric measures of impairment were predictive of the progression to moderate or severe dementia. Electrophysiologic and CT measures were not. In a discriminant function analysis, the scores on two measures (the digit symbol subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and an Aphasia Battery) correctly predicted the stage of dementia 1 year later in 95% of the subjects.
