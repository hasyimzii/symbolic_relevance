Computed tomography in soft tissue disorders of the lower extremities.
Computed Tomography (CT) constitutes an important new imaging modality in the evaluation of soft tissue tumors. They are detectable by CT because their density is different from that of muscles and because they cause displacement of normal structures. CT was found to be useful in demonstrating the true extent of lesions in the soft tissue of the lower extremities of 24 patients as confirmed by examination of the surgically removed tumors. CT was also able to define the lesions' relation to and involvement with the surrounding tissue. We were not able to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions by CT. Generally, the specific attenuation values were not helpful in differentiation between various types of tumors. However, in cases of tumors such as lipomas, cysts and neurofibromas it may be of some use.
