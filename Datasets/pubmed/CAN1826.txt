Juxtacortical osteogenic sarcoma of the jaws. Review of the literature and report of a case.
The juxtacortical osteogenic sarcoma is a rate tumor, especially in the jaws. Until now, only six cases have been reported. Before describing an additional case in the mandible, it was deemed appropriate to review the literature on juxtacortical osteogenic sarcoma in extracraniofacial locations as well. The data on juxtacortical osteogenic sarcomas of the long bones and those of the jaws are discussed.
