Lithium induced accentuation of extrapyramidal symptoms in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.
Lithium treatment in 9 elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease led to a marked accentuation of extra pyramidal symptoms (EPS) in 5 of 6 patients with preexisting EPS. EPS scores significantly correlated with plasma and RBC lithium levels. Lithium treatment had no such effects in the 3 patients without preexisting extrapyramidal symptoms.
