Evaluation of an atypical HIV type 1 antibody. Serologic pattern leading to detection of HIV type 2 infection in North America.
The variability and discordance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) antibody enzyme immunoassay determinations on serial specimens derived, to our knowledge, from the first documented case of HIV 2 infection in North America are described. The initial specimen was weakly reactive, but two subsequent serum specimens were both nonreactive by enzyme immunoassay. All specimens were indeterminate for HIV 1 antibody by HIV 1 Western blot analysis. Serum HIV 2 antibody was demonstrated by enzyme immunoassay using whole virus lysate, HIV 2 specific synthetic peptide assays, and HIV 2 Western blot analysis. Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 genomic sequences were demonstrated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using gene amplification technology. Human immunodeficiency virus type 2, isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes, had typical morphologic features of lenti virus by electron microscopy. Western blot analysis and other specific assays should be considered in individuals with clinical evidence suggesting HIV infection who are nonreactive for HIV 1 antibody by enzyme immunoassay or who have atypical reactivity patterns.
