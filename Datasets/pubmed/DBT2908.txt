Trehalase activity in genetically diabetic mice (serum, kidney, and liver).
Trehalase activity was determined in serum, liver, and kidney in alloxan treated  Swiss mice and in homozygous (Ob/Ob, Db/Db) and heterozygous (Ob/+, Db/m+) diabetic mice. Both alloxan and genetic diabetic mice exhibited a large increase in serum and liver trehalase activity with no change in kidney trehalase activity. The heterozygotes (Ob/+, Db/m+) showed only a slight increase of enzyme activity. Further quantitative differences were noticed between the genetic and alloxan diabetic animals. The liver enzyme activity increased from 10  to more than 20 fold in the liver of the homozygous Ob/Ob and Db/Db strains and only 3 fold (not significant compared to controls) in the alloxan treated animals. The above results suggest a regulatory relationship between the genes coding for trehalase and the enzymes of glucose metabolism activity involved in the development of the metabolic anomalies of diabetes. The structural gene for trehalase may well have survived elimination of selective pressure during phylogenesis and remained part of a co regulated group of glucose metabolising enzymes. This could explain its sensitivity to mutations affecting glucose metabolism and its sensitivity to insulin directed regulatory mechanisms.
