Collagen metabolism in the myocardium from streptozotocin diabetic rats.
The effect of diabetes on myocardial collagen metabolism was investigated in rats. Diabetes was induced by an i.v. injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). The animals were killed after 3, 6, 18, or 26 wk of diabetes. Urinary glucose levels were measured by Tes Tape. The myocardium was quickly removed and homogenized. Collagen was estimated by hydroxyproline content. Collagen synthesis was measured by 14C proline incorporation. Myocardial collagen concentration and collagen synthesis was not altered in the diabetic rats. Collagen concentration did appear to increase in the 18  and 26 wk rats, but this was probably an age related phenomenon. These results suggest that diabetes does not alter collagen metabolism in rats.
