Porcine intestinal adenomatosis: epithelial dysplasia and infiltration.
Occasionally in cases of porcine intestinal adenomatosis (PIA) epithelial dysplasia is seen with infiltration of the epithelium into underlying tissues and spread, via the lymphatics, to drainage lymph nodes. The intracellular bacterium Campylobacter sputorum subspecies mucosalis, associated with PIA, can be demonstrated in the epithelial cells of the metastases. This dysplasia and infiltration appears to be related to surface damage and inflammation.
