A national voice for information about HIV infections: the Italian state AIDS hot line.
Because of the variety of problems connected with the AIDS epidemic, there is an  urgent need for qualified information and counselling. In June 1987, The Italian Ministry of Health established a hot line, acting within the National AIDS Operational Centre. Through the analysis of more than 39,000 calls received during the first year of activity, a clear outline has been obtained of the emotional impact of the disease on Italian public opinion, and of the problems raised. 67% of callers belong to 20 39 age group; the male/female ratio is 2:1. Interesting correlations have been found between the content of the questions and the sex, age, and type of caller. The vast majority of questions concerning basic concepts and notions about HIV infections are asked by no risk related subjects. During the first year, the percentage of questions asked by subjects actually at risk increased, and the questions themselves have become more specific.
