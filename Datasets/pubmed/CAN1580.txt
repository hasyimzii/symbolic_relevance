A role of glycerol in contrast enhancement (author's transl).
In some cases of glioma, it may be relatively difficult to demonstrate by computed tomography (CT), or even by contrast enhancement technique (CE). Studying a series of delayed CT scans, it seems that one of the main factors of delayed CE effect is due to extravascular components of iodine. So for getting better CE effect in these gliomas, we tried to increase the extravascular iodine concentration with utilizing the returning water of intravenously administrated Glycerol. By this method of drip injection of contrast material following the Glycerol, we could get an increase of CE effect of 40 or 70% comparing to the usual drip injected CE scans in two benign gliomas, but we couldn't find the difference in one malignant glioma and in the high vascular area of the benign gliomas. Though the mechanism was not completely explained in this article, we thought that CE effect in malignant gliomas or high vascular tumors was mainly by intravascular component of iodine. This malignant glioma a big cyst, and with the use of intravenous contrast material and delayed CT scanning, we had been able to know that contrast media entered cystic collections, which progressively increased in density and were maximally enhanced on delayed, 180 minutes after injection of contrast material.
