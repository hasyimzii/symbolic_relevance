Plasma prekallikrein (Fletcher factor) deficiency in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
We have described the first patient to be reported in whom plasma prekallikrein (Fletcher factor) deficiency and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were both present. This most likely represents a coincidental occurrence, but the markedly elevated peripheral blood lymphocyte count and the detection of the defect using ellagic acid are unique for Fletcher factor deficiency.
