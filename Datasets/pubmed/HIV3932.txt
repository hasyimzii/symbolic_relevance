Synthesis of 3' (4 nitroimidazol 1 yl) 2',3' dideoxynucleosides of pyrimidine analogues and their biological evaluation against HIV.
Reaction of 1,5 di O acetyl 2,3 dideoxy 3 phthalimido beta D erythro pento fur anose (1) with silylated pyrimidinediones 2a c using the Lewis acid trimethylsilyl triflate as catalyst afforded nucleosides 3a c and 4a,c which were deprotected with 33% methylamine/ethanol to give the corresponding 3 aminonucleosides 5a c and 6. These were reacted with 1,4 dinitroimidazoles 7a,b to give the 3 imidazolyldideoxynucleosides 8a,b and 9a f. At sub toxic concentrations these compounds were ineffective against HIV 1.
