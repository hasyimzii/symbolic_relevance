Polyneuritis cranialis as a presentation of malignant lymphoma.
Two cases of polyneuritis cranialis resulting from infiltration of nerve roots by malignant lymphoma are described, and 8 previously reported cases discussed. In these, cranial nerve involvement was the presenting feature of lymphoma, and lesions at other sites were inconspicuous until necropsy. In one patient infectious mononucleosis developed concurrently with the neurological deficit. The course of this condition is progressive and fatal.
