The biphasic contrast method in the stomach examination. A comparative study with standard method and correlations with endoscopy (author's transl).
A two years experience, using the biphasic contrast method in the evaluation of the stomach, is reported. Endoscopic and radiological results are compared. Our previous reports with standard contrast method are also reviewed. Ulcerative and neoplastic pathologies were studied and classified as proposed in the "trial policentrico multidisciplinare paritetico". The double contrast method has greatly increased the accuracy of X ray diagnosis, considerably reducing the difference with endoscopy.
