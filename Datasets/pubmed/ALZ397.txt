Deoxyglucose uptake and choline acetyltransferase activity in cerebral cortex following lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis.
The uptake of [3H]2 deoxyglucose (2 DG) into various brain regions of rats with unilateral or bilateral lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM) was measured. The activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in these brain regions was also determined. Lesions of the nBM caused a significant decrease in cortical ChAT activity but had no effect on 2 DG accumulation. Pentobarbital treatment reduced 2 DG accumulation in all brain areas examined and these reductions were not influenced by the nBM lesions. The results indicate that a decrease in the cholinergic innervation of the cortex does not influence cortical glucose utilization. It appears unlikely, therefore, that the reported decrease in cortical glucose utilization in Alzheimer's disease is related to degeneration of the nBM cortical cholinergic projection.
