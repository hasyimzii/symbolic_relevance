Malignancies of the uterine body among Ibo women in Nigeria.
Out of the 85 malignancies of the uterus seen at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, in the past seven years, only seven were malignancies of the uterine body. Compared with reports by other authors, the incidence is low and suggests the influence of racial and geographical factors. With the exception of one patient, the majority presented in the 50 70 year age group. More than one half of the patients were of high parity; menorrhagia was a common presenting symptom. In the absence of facilities for radiotherapy, surgery alone produces a reasonably good result for the early stages of this disease. Abnormal uterine bleeding in women over 30 years of age should be fully investigated.
