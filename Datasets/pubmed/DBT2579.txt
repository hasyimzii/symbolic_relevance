Epilepsia partialis continua associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia: clinical and biochemical profile of 21 patients.
In 21 patients, epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) was an early symptom of nonketotic hyperglycemia and occurred during an initial phase of hyponatremia and mild hyperosmolality. EPC persisted for an average of 8 days, and its duration correlated predominantly with the degree of hyponatremia. Depression of consciousness and cessation of seizures occurred with increasing severity of hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality. In 9 patients, EPC was the first symptom leading to the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Four patients died of serious associated illness. The majority of the patients had evidence of a localized structural cerebral lesion. Metabolic disturbances including hyperglycemia, mild hyperosmolality, hyponatremia, and lack of ketoacidosis contribute to the development of EPC in areas of focal cerebral damage.
