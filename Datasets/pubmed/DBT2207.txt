Diabetic staff simulation of insulin dependent diabetic life.
Diabetic staff members, including doctors, nurses, and paramedical personnel, participated in a 1 wk experiment in which the life style of a patient with insulin dependent diabetes was stimulated. The respondents underwent reaching in (1) urine testing and recording results, (2) twice daily "insulin" regimen, and (3) diet involving regularly spaced carbohydrate in meals and snacks. Evaluation was conducted at several levels. The nurse educator assessed the pseudo patients' performance. Staff members evaluated the teaching. Most important, the staff came to appreciate unforseen minutiae and pitfalls in the practical aspects of daily living as ordinarily prescribed by medical attendants. The simulation experiment is recommended for all staff involved in diabetic education.
