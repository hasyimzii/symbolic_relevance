Carcinoid tumors, carcinoid syndromes and related tumors (104 cases).
One hundred and four consecutive cases of carcinoid among 194 APUD omas (cerebral and gynecological tumours expected) are presented. Localization is as follows: bronchopulmonary (21%), duodenum (5,5%), small intestine (19%), Meckel's diverticulum (5,5%), appendix (39%), colorectal (5,5%), other (4,5%). Average age at diagnosis is very different for each localization of carcinoid tumour, as is prognosis: in our material, 33% of cases had an infiltrative tumour, 17% had lymph nodes metastases and 16% hepatic metastases. All 15 patients with carcinoidosis died but their survival varied considerably in length (from a few weeks to 21 years after the beginning of carcinoidosis). In addition, 3 patients presented with the Zollinger Ellison syndrome, 2 of them having an atypical or probable form of the MEN I syndrome.
