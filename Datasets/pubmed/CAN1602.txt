Surgical and combined treatment of kidney cancer.
A comparative analysis of two clinical groups of patients was performed in order  to study the influence of postoperative irradiation on the results of the treatment of only the surgical treatment (nephrectomy). The second group (63 patients) was subjected to a combined treatment   nephrectomy and irradiation. In the first group the survival rate for 3 and 5 years was 40,0% and 20,0%, in the second group 49,9% and 31,7% respectively. The survival rate was higher in the combined treatment because of less recidivation of carcinoma (14,3%), although the frequency of the metastatic spread in the both groups was almost the same 50,6% and 54,0%.
