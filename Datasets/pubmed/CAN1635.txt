High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of urinary catecholamines employing amperometric detection: references values and use in laboratory diagnosis of neural crest tumors.
We have developed an high performance liquid chromatographic procedure employing  amperometric detection for the measurement of urinary free norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine. The between day precision (C.V.) at various concentrations of the above analytes varied from 4.8 11.6%. There was negligible between urine difference in the percent recovery of norepinephrine and epinephrine but considerable between urine difference for dopamine. The procedure has been used to determine reference ranges in infants, children and adults. Its preliminary application to the laboratory detection of neural crest tumors is also described.
