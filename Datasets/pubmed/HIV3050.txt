Prevalence of HTLV III/LAV antibody in selected populations in Thailand.
Antibody to the human T lymphotropic virus, type III/lymphadenopathy associated virus (HTLV III/LAV) by ELISA test was detected in one (1%) of 101 male homosexual prostitutes (confidence limit 95%:0.03 5.4%, in two (2%) of 100 thalassemia patients, and in none (C.L. 95%:0 3.6%) of 100 female prostitutes, 99 parenteral drug abusers, 100 male VD patients, 100 consecutive blood donors in serum collected from February through June 1985. Serum from the positive homosexual subject was strongly positive on repeated ELISA testing, and was also positive by Western Blot test. The two thalassemia patients, who were repeatedly weakly positive by ELISA, were negative by Western Blot test and presumed to be false positive reactors. Prevalence of HTLV III/LAV virus in sexually active homosexuals in Thailand in 1985 appears to be similar to the 1% rate among homosexuals in San Francisco in 1978 at the start of the AIDS epidemic there.
