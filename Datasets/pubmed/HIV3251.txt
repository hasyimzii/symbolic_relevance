Serological responses in chimpanzees inoculated with human immunodeficiency virus glycoprotein (gp120) subunit vaccine.
The major envelope glycoprotein of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been  purified and was utilized as a prototype vaccine in chimpanzees. The 120,000 dalton glycoprotein (gp120) was purified from membranes of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) IIIB infected cells and the final preparation contained low levels to no detectable HTLV IIIB core antigen (p24) and low levels of endotoxin. Chimpanzees inoculated with gp120 responded by developing antibodies that precipitated radiolabeled gp120 and neutralized in vitro infection of HTLV IIIB. Antibodies to HTLV IIIB p24 were not detected in the gp120 immunized chimpanzees. Peripheral blood leukocytes from the vaccinated animals were examined for T4+ and T8+ cells, and no decrease in the T4/T8 ratio was found, indicating that immunization with a ligand (gp120) that binds to T4 has no detectable adverse effect on the population of T4+ cells. The only current animal model that can be reproducibly infected with HIV is the chimpanzee. Immunization of chimpanzees with HIV proteins will provide an experimental system for testing the effectiveness of prototype vaccines for preventing HIV infection in vivo.
