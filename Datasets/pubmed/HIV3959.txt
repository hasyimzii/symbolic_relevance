Psychosocial problems in HIV infected families  possibilities for coping.
The psychosocial problems of 49 HIV exposed children (data given as of September  1989) and 19 HIV infected hemophiliacs cared for in the pediatric immuno deficiency clinic of the Munich university hospital are described in detail. Drug addiction, financial needs, housing problems and delinquency play an important role in the first group. Hemophiliacs, however, live in more stable family conditions. Both groups are offered counseling, home and hospital visits, and legal, administrative and financial support. Furthermore we help with coordinating regular meetings, obtaining short time housekeepers and arranging long term addiction treatments for mother and child. When dealing with hemophilic patients our team is frequently confronted with problems of friendship, sexuality and professional training.
