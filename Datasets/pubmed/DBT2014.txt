Hypertension in general practice. Part I. Examination and investigation of a patient with hypertension.
During the history taking and physical examination, several important diseases should be searched for before diagnosing essential hypertension. A critical investigation is repetitive abdominal auscultation for a bruit. In young patients with significant hypertension, coarctation of the aorta must be excluded by clinical examination. Investigations will especially be aimed at uncovering renal artery disease (relatively common) or a phaechromocytoma (relatively rare). The initial assessment must also diagnose associated diseases which will influence the type of therapy chose. Thus asthma and heart failure contraindicate beta blockers, liver disease contraindicates methyldopa, severe depression contraindicates reserpine, methyldopa and beta blockade, while diabetes or gout may be precipitated or aggravated by thiazide diuretics.
