Portal somatostatin responds to intragastric glucose: effects of streptozotocin diabetes.
Changes in somatostatin levels in portal response to intragastric glucose loading were examined in normal controls and streptozotocin diabetic rats for one week duration. The mean (+/  SEM) basal level of somatostatin was more significantly elevated in diabetic rats (401 +/  62 pg/ml) than in controls (171 +/  13 pg/ml). However, no significant difference in somatostatin concentrations 30 min after glucose loading was found between diabetic and control animals (587 +/  113 vs. 443 +/  47 pg/ml). Glucose loading caused a significant elevation of somatostatin in controls, but not in diabetic rats. These results suggest a physiologic role of somatostatin in nutrient homeostasis, and that abnormalities in D cell function are present in streptozotocin diabetes of short duration.
