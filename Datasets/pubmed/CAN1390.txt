Hyperthyroidism and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.
Unsuspected, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid was found on microscopic examination of thyroid tissue removed for treatment of hyperthyroidism in a 30 year old woman. Preoperatively, the hyperthyroidism was attributed to Graves' disease, even though the patient had no pretibial myxedema or ophthalmic signs of Graves' disease. The possibility that the hyperthyroidism was secondary to a "thyroid stimulator" produced by the medullary carcinoma is discussed.
