Gastric inhibitory polypeptide.
The available data show that GIP is at present the strongest candidate for the insulin secreting factor of the gut named incretin. Its release is triggered by the absorption of ingested nutrients. GIP acts on the B cells of the pancreas by potentiating glucose induced insulin secretion. The role of GIP as an enterogastrone is less well established. The release of GIP from the gut cells seems to be regulated by the composition and the amount of the ingested food, by the rate of absorption of nutrients by neural factors (vagal), and by feedback control mediated by insulin. In addition, the adaptation of the intestine to individual eating habits influences the response of the GIP cells. It is suggested that an overactive enteroinsular axis, i.e. enhanced GIP secretion, participates in the development of the hyperinsulinaemia of obesity and maturity onset diabetes mellitus. In gastrointestinal diseases accompanied by malabsorption the GIP response is diminished. In gastrointestinal disorders with rapid gastric emptying (duodenal ulcer) or with accelerated passage of the nutrients through the intestine, hypersecretion of GIP and insulin occurs. This may be significant for the reactive hypoglycaemia of these conditions.
