The orthopedic surgeon and hemochromatosis.
In many communities the orthopedic surgeon who also functions as the rheumatologist may have the best opportunity to make an early diagnosis of hemochromatosis by recognizing the characteristic features of this form of arthritis, which is associated with skin pigmentation, liver disease, or diabetes. Elevated serum iron levels and saturation of serum iron binding capacity suggest the diagnosis, and a highly elevated serum ferritin level confirms it. Physicians who treat patients with arthritis, performing hand, bunion, or joint replacement surgery, need to be alert for this disorder. CI    Copyright 2013, SLACK Incorporated.
