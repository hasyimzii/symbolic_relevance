An epidemiological study of endometrial cancer. Controlled trial of 501 cases (author's transl).
In a retrospective case control study, 501 cases of endometrial cancer were observed from 1955 1975 and an equal number of matched control cases were compared regarding the following parameters: obesity, hypertension, diabetes, age a menopause, parity, age at first and last delivery, age at menarche, menstrual abnormalities, history of prior endometrial biopsies, concomitant ovarian tumours, family history of cancer and history of exposure to radiation. The statistical analysis revealed significant differences regarding the incidence of obesity, hypertension, late menopause, low parity, prior endometrial biopsies and prior exposure to ionizing radiation. However, no significant difference was found between endometrial cancer patients and control patients as to the incidence of diabetes, age at menarche, age at first delivery and family history of cancer. The results of the investigation are discussed and compared with similar reports from the literature.
