Mechanism of inhibitory effect of glycyrrhizin on replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Glycyrrhizin (GL) achieved a dose dependent inhibition of the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) in MOLT 4 (clone No. 8) cells within the concentration range of 0.075 to 0.6 mM. Within this concentration range, GL also effected a dose dependent reduction in the protein kinase C (PKC) activity of MOLT 4 (clone No. 8) cells. A well known PKC inhibitor, 1 (5 isoquinolinesulfonyl) 2 methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H 7), also proved inhibitory to HIV 1 replication in MOLT 4 (clone No. 8) cells. PKC inhibition may thus be considered as one of the mechanisms by which GL inhibits HIV 1 replication. In addition, GL may also owe its anti HIV 1 activity, at least in part, to an interference with virus cell binding, since the compound at 1.2 mM partially inhibited the adsorption of radiolabeled HIV 1 particles to MT 4 cells. At this concentration GL also suppressed giant cell formation induced by co culturing MOLT 4 (clone No. 8) cells with MOLT 4/HTLV IIIB cells, whereas the PKC inhibitor H 7 failed to do so.
