Cortical serotonin S2 receptor binding abnormalities in patients with Alzheimer's disease: comparisons with Parkinson's disease.
Reductions in the numbers of binding sites for the serotonergic S2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin, are, as previously reported, evident in Alzheimer's disease. New findings indicate that these sites are not affected in the cortex of patients with Parkinson's disease despite the presence of cognitive impairment. In contrast S1 receptor binding sites were reduced to a small but significant extent in both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease with cognitive deficit. The S2 receptor binding loss was not related to the cholinergic deficit (decreased choline acetyltransferase) common to both disorders nor to the presence of cortical senile plaques but did relate to the extent of cortical neurofibrillary tangle formation, evident in Alzheimer's but not generally in Parkinson's disease. These observations suggest that S2  but not S1 receptor binding abnormalities may reflect an important intrinsic cortical involvement specifically associated with the Alzheimer disease process.
