Cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Considerations on a clinical case.
A case of pancreatic cystoadenocarcinoma treated surgically four years earlier as a pancreatic pseudocyst is reported. The problems of differential diagnosis between cystic tumours (cystoadenoma and cystoadenocarcinoma) and the more common pseudocystic lesions are analysed. Stress is laid on the importance of correct intra operative diagnosis, mainly based on multiple biopsy of the cyst wall, and the need for radical exeresis.
