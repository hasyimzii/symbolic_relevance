Changes in glycosylated haemoglobin after poor control in insulin dependent diabetics.
Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1) was measured in seven insulin dependent diabetic  patients before, during, and after a seven day period of monitored poor control. There was considerable individual variation in the pattern and degree of change in HbA1 concentration induced by poor control and the time when it occurred. Greater increases in HbA1 were seen during the period of metabolic derangement than in the subsequent two months. More information is required before HbA1 estimations are widely used clinically to monitor control in individual diabetics.
