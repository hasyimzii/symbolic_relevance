The dissolution of language in Alzheimer's disease.
Language impairment in Alzheimer's disease has become an important clinical issue. It has been recognized for some time that the disease may begin with aphasia and even before frank aphasia develops, some of the earliest changes in a large number of individuals consist of impairment of word fluency and semantic access manifesting itself in word finding difficulty. The second major issue concerning language in Alzheimer's disease is that the cases which have early severe language impairment may represent a more progressive familial variety of disease as it has been suggested in the literature. This is still subject to controversy. Finally, it will be documented that the later stage of the disease shows language invariably impaired and goes through stages of dissolution that resemble anomic, transcortical sensory. Wernicke's and global aphasias. Accurate assessment of language may turn out to be one of the most reliable predictors of the stages of Alzheimer's disease and provides important insights into the cerebral organization of language, semantic access, relationship of semantic and episodic memory and the pathophysiology of the disease.
