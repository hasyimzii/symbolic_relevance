Rubeosis iridis following pars plana vitrectomy (author's transl).
Rubeosis iridis following pars plana vitrectomy was studied in 150 patients. In patients with vasoproliferative diseases, retinal detachment and chronic uveitis there is a high risk that rubeosis iridis will develop. Rubeosis is more frequent in aphakic patients. In most cases rubeosis iridis is already present and progresses following surgery. Irisangiography may be necessary to demonstrate the existing iridic neovascularization. Rubeosis iridis influences the visual prognosis. The success rate in patients with postoperative rubeosis iridis is only half that in patients who are not suffering from this condition.
