Arteriography of coronary disease at clinical onset.
The coronary arteriographic anatomic findings in 491 male patients clinically symptomatic for less than six months are described. Single and multiple vessel disease was noted, respectively, in 40 and 60 percent with 6.5 percent also manifesting left main coronary disease. Our findings indicate that severe coronary artery disease is present early in the symptomatic phase and that patients presenting with initial inferior myocardial infarctions may represent a select group having an excessive frequency of severe coronary disease suitable for early angiographic detection and surgical bypass therapy.
