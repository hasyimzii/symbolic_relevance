Tumor necrosis factor alpha induces a kappa B sequence specific DNA binding protein in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells.
Tumor necrosis factor alpha is an inducer of acute phase protein synthesis in liver cells. The mechanism by which tumor necrosis factor alpha alters gene expression in these cells is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulates human immunodeficiency virus 1 long terminal repeat promoted gene expression in the human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell line and increased binding of trans activating factors to kappa B (kappa B) DNA sequences. In contrast to lymphocytic cells where the nuclear factors recognizing the kappa B sequences are activated by both tumor necrosis factor alpha and phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate through a posttranslational mechanism, in HepG2 cells phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate does not activate these factor(s), and de novo protein synthesis seems to be required in HepG2 cells for gene activation by tumor necrosis factor alpha.
