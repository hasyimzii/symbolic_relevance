Effect of long term metformin treatment on the development of diabetes in genetically diabetic mice (DBM) (author's transl).
Genetic diabetic obese, hyperinsulinaemic mice of the DBM (db/db) strain received long term metformin. The drug was given orally (200 mg/kg twice a day) by gastric intubation starting from the 13th week of age to the 42 th. A continuing hypoglycemic effect was observed with a simultaneous decrease of HbA1c. The immunoreactive plasma insulin and body weight of treated homozygous mice were higher than those of homozygous controls. No significant modification of food consumption and blood lipids was noted. Pancreatic islets of homozygous controls showed, by light and electron microscopy, a characteristic hypersecreting appearance at 25 th week compared to that of heterozygous animals. Morphological dedifferentiation (canalicular changes and foreign cell colonization) followed in most cases at the 42 th week with reduction in B cells. Pancreas of treated mice was similar to that of controls at 25 th but showed less B cell exhaustion and islet degeneration at the 42 th week, explaining higher plasma IRI concentration.
