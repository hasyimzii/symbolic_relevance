Distribution of complement C'2 and C'6 types in Australian cases of diabetes mellitus.
A series of patients with juvenile onset diabetes (IDDM) and mature onset diabetes (NIDDM) have been typed for genetic variants of two sets of complement factors. For the HLA linked C'2 system, there was found a significant increase of the C'2 2 1 type in IDDM compared with NIDDM patients or healthy controls. No such increase in any phenotype was observed for the non HLA linked C'6 system. These observations emphasize again the genetic distinction between IDDM and NIDDM, and the role of chromosome 6 in controlling susceptibility to the insulin dependent form of the disease.
