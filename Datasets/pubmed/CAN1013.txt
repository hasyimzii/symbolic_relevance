Mobile dispersed genetic elements and their possible relation to carcinogenesis.
In this paper, a hypothesis is described according to which mobile dispersed genetic elements are related to endogenous viral genomes and may be involved in oncogenic transformation by uptaking cellular genes important for cellular growth. It is also possible that, in certain cases, they can switch off the genes involved in the control of differentiation.
