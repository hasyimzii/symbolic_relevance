Infection of the SCID hu mouse by HIV 1.
SCID hu mice with human fetal thymic or lymph node implants were inoculated with  the cloned human immunodeficiency virus 1 isolate, HIV 1JR CSF. In a time  and dose dependent fashion, viral replication spread within the human lymphoid organs. Combination immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed only viral RNA transcripts in most infected cells, but some cells had both detectable viral transcripts and viral protein. Infected cells were always more apparent in the medulla than in the cortex of the thymus. These studies demonstrate that an acute infection of human lymphoid organs with HIV 1 can be followed in the SCID hu mouse.
