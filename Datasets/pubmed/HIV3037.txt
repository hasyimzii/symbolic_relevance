HTLV III: the etiologic agent of AIDS.
A retrovirus belonging to the family of human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) was isolated from several patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS related complex (ARC) and asymptomatic homosexual males at increased risk of developing AIDS. This new virus was designated HTLV III. A serological screening procedure incorporating an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a radioimmunoassay using a Western blot technique was developed employing disrupted HTLV III as the antigen source. These assays identified serum antibodies to HTLV III antigens in almost all patients with AIDS, greater than 90% patients with ARC and about 40% of homosexual males at risk for developing AIDS. In a study of transfusion associated AIDS (TA AIDS) all 19 of the TA AIDS cases had antibodies to HTLV III. Similarly 31 of 35 high risk donors who donated to cases of TA AIDS had antibodies to HTLV III. All four of the antibody negative high risk donors donated to cases that received blood from at least one other high risk donor. In contrast only 2 of 255 other donors were antibody positive. The data clearly indicate that TA AIDS cases developed the disease as a result of transmission of HTLV III through contaminated blood and that HTLV III is the primary etiologic agent of AIDS.
