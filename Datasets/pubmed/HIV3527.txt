Neurological presentations of AIDS  when to test for HIV.
Nine of 122 patients dead from AIDS in central London presented with neurological disease, confirmed pathologically in seven. Seven had no other major systemic manifestations. AIDS needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of meningitis, dementia, diffuse and focal encephalopathies, brainstem syndromes, myelopathy, visual failure and peripheral nerve syndromes. As AIDS becomes more widespread there will be an increasing need for diagnostic HIV testing in many neurological syndromes.
