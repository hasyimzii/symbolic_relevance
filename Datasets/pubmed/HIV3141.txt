Increased interleukin 2 receptor expression after mitogen stimulation on CD4  and CD8 positive lymphocytes and decreased interleukin 2 production in HTLV III antibody positive symptomatic individuals.
We investigated the expression of the interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptor on phytohaemagglutin stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from homosexual men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, the prodrome of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The subjects were positive for antibody against human T cell lymphotropic virus III. Using two colour fluorescence flow cytometry, IL 2 receptor expression was determined on both the CD4  and CD8 positive lymphocyte subpopulations. After 48 hr of stimulation, expression of the IL 2 receptor on both T cell subsets was significantly increased in lymphadenopathy patients as compared to values in heterosexual age matched controls; this difference was less after 72 hr of stimulation. Results from two AIDS patients were within the normal range. IL 2 production was significantly reduced in both lymphadenopathy and AIDS patients as compared to values in heterosexual controls. We conclude that a defect in IL 2 production is associated with human T cell lymphotropic virus III infection, but that the expression of the IL 2 receptor on T cells is not greatly affected.
