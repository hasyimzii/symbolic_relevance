Dual parameter flow cytometry studies in human lymphomas.
Dual parameter flow cytometry studies using Coulter volume and cell DNA content were carried out in monodisperse cell suspensions of 64 samples of human lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and benign lymphoid proliferations. Differences in mean Coulter volume among the lymphomas were due both to the intrinsic differences in mean G1 cell Coulter volume and to the presence of increased fractions of larger S and G2 cells, especially among the large B cell lymphomas. However, the relative contribution of large non G1 cells to the overall population Coulter volume distribution was a relatively minor one; the presence of cells in S did not increase mean Coulter volume by more than 10%, even in samples with high S fractions. There was a good correlation between mean G1 cell Coulter volume and the log of the fraction of cells in S among the B cell lymphomas (r = 0.55). Evidence is presented that within individual samples, large cells proliferate more rapidly than small cells. This was seen in every case, both in the normal samples and in the lymphomas, and in the T cell lymphomas as well as in the B cell lymphomas. Aneuploidy was detected by flow cytometry in 11 cases; in 7 cases the aneuploid cell component could be analyzed separately from the diploid cell component on the basis of cell Coulter volume differences. The aneuploid components of diploid aneuploid mixtures had higher S fractions than the diploid components in six of seven cases (0.16 +/  0.04 [SE] vs. 0.08 +/  0.02). These findings are considered in relation to the histopathological classification of the lymphomas, and in relation to the concept of clonal selection and clonal evolution of tumors.
