Multiple sclerosis and human T cell lymphotropic retroviruses: negative serological results in 135 German patients.
A total of 135 sera and 18 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were screened for antibodies to human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV I) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by ELISA tests. None of the sera or CSF reacted with HIV antigens. Only 3 out of 135 MS sera but no MS CSF showed increased reactions in the ELISA test for HTLV I. However, these positive reactions were classified as non specific by immunoprecipitation. Thus no serological evidence for infection with HIV, HTLV I, or a related retrovirus was found in the MS patients.
