Non invasive study of carotid arteries by echo doppler and metabolic abnormalities in patients with dementia.
In order to evaluate the prevalence of common and/or internal carotid stenoses together with metabolic abnormalities in dementia nineteen patients were investigated. Dementia and differential diagnosis between Alzheimer type (DAT) and multi infarctual (MID) dementia were performed on the basis of Computerized Tomography scan, behavioural anamnesis, neurological and neuropsychological examinations. Eight patients were diagnosed as MID and 11 as DAT. Noninvasive study of neck arteries was performed in supine position by a Duplex Scanner, able of detecting a wide range of stenosis, even when very mild. Arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and high hematocrit level were present in both groups, although to a higher extent in MID (p 0.05). Results from Duplex Scanner demonstrate 12 vascular stenoses 16 49% and one between 50 99% (13/76), being vascular abnormalities equally distributed among DAT and MID patients. These data suggest that patients with metabolic abnormalities and arteriosclerosis can develop dementia not necessarily of vascular type. On the other hand, MID patients do not present higher number of stenosis as compared to DAT, indicating that vascular disease of carotid arteries is not prominent in the clinical context of dementia.
