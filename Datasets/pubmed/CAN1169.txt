Transformation by cloned Harvey murine sarcoma virus DNA: efficiency increased by long terminal repeat DNA.
The coding sequences for the transforming (src) protein (p21) of Harvey murine sarcoma virus have been localized to a 1.3 kilobase pair segment near the 5' end of the viral genome. Ligation of the viral terminal repeat DNA to the left end of the src region DNA markedly enhanced the low transforming efficiency of the src region DNA.
