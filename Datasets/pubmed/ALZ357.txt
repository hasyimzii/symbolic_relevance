Familial motor neurone disease associated with non specific organic dementia. A clinico pathological study of a family.
Two sisters developed motor neurone disease (MND), which was associated with progressive intellectual impairment in one; they survived for 18 and 24 months, respectively. At necropsy, the features of MND were confirmed, and the demented patient had severe non specific cerebral atrophy. No evidence of Alzheimer's disease was found. Organic dementia of non specific type can be associated with up to 15% of the familial cases of MND and with about 2% of the sporadic cases of MND in the Western world.
