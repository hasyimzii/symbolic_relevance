AIDS and pedodontics: the real risk and its prevention.
The daily increase in carriers of the AIDS virus (150,000 is the latest estimate  for Italy) means that the dentist must pay the utmost attention in selecting cases at risk and in defending himself from the possibility of contagion. Albeit to a lesser extent, the pedodontist is also involved in this problem. Here situations in which the risk of contagion is greatest because of the patient's social position or associated pathologies and the difficulty of the operation required are reported and some indications are offered to guide the pedodontist's professional behaviour.
