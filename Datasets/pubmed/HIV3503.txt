The neurological features of early and 'latent' human immunodeficiency virus infection.
Neurological manifestations of unknown cause occurring in patients who become or  are HIV antibody positive with presumed normal immune function have been described recently. This report adds a further six cases, all of whom had normal CD4+ cell counts either throughout the period of observation or after the episode of seroconversion. Three had an acute presentation, two in the context of documented seroconversion consisting of one of the following: an encephalitis, an ataxia, and confusion with neuralgic amyotrophy. Three had a subacute disorder occurring at a later phase of HIV infection but before opportunistic infections or neoplasms, and marked by a static mild cognitive deficit. This report extends the range of abnormalities that may be seen at seroconversion and documents the presence of a non progressive cognitive deficit occurring in the latent phase of HIV infection.
